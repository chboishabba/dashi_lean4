-- Canonical grep-first owner for current proof search.
-- Active lanes: Navier-Stokes + Yang-Mills + Riemann Hypothesis.
-- GR-QFT remains a continuity coordinate only.
--
-- The current search policy is the repo-native Ibrahim traversal policy:
-- explicit formulation owner -> typed dependency -> typed generalisation.
-- Source/QID/Dewey/OEIS/link/date coordinates may support or identify a node
-- but never replace the formulation owner or manufacture theorem payment.
--
-- NS correction (2026-09-11): C_direct is fully constructed as a live
-- pair/fibre/global/trajectory/integrated observable.  The unpaid authority is
-- its producer, minimized to the live R568 commutator-only spacetime budget.

-- NS representation-weld update timestamp:

  "Finish periodic 3D NS arbitrary-data critical control on the literal live Galerkin trajectory without replacing the signed carrier by a premature positive majorant."
  "C_direct exists and is same-object welded: old R104 remainder F_N = literal R406 remainder integral = 4 * integratedDirectCompanion. R503 is the terminal consumer; R568 is the nearest new PDE producer interface."
  "Construct CommutatorOnlySpacetimeBudget568. Highest-alpha local analytic splice is now the homochiral radial-near amplitude/Taylor-moment certificate on the exact R571 carrier; the generic official torus character adaptor and the R571/R311/R27 homochiral radial same-object weld are source-written."
  "R310 closes a<->b inner-fibre swap pairing; R571 expands arbitrary raw velocity pairs into four exact R106 multiplier-difference channels; R573 carries the actual R294 weight through the outer slot before norms; R574 gives each channel the low-output bound; R575 collapses four scalar component majorants with no factor four; OfficialPeriodicTorusCharacterIntegralExact isolates standard-imported Haar/exponential-character authority and reuses finite character algebra; R571HomochiralRadialIncrementSpecializationExact closes the rational ++/-- carrier weld; R572 compiles the R568 budget into R503."
  "Use the official torus character adaptor plus the closed R571 homochiral radial weld to construct the radial-near amplitude certificate, then feed the old paired second-order identity, second-moment bound, six-three arithmetic, and R89 two-derivative payment before falling back to R577 positive nested Schur."
  "Do not say C_direct is missing. Do not promote the standard-imported Haar/Bochner authority to a machine-checked continuum theorem. Do not identify Fourier-leg swap a<->b with kernel displacement y<->-y without the typed Fourier/increment realization. Do not replace the signed R294 weight by its positive envelope before swap/centering. Do not claim 369 proves the Gram/Rayleigh or R568 theorem."

  "Finish the Jaffe-Witten existence + mass-gap problem on one literal compact-simple continuum construction."
  "Whole problem remains the frozen four physical rows A/B/C/D. Source, operator/continuum and row-local clocks are kept separate."
  "FIRST SOURCE COORDINATE: literal CMP119 raw source objects over the existing finite beta history. SECOND, blocked by the first: the literal Section-2 predicate vocabulary indexed by that exact raw state. The same-coupling weld and CMP122 active Section-2 transport are already machine checked."
  "Round58 constructs runningCoupling=History.couplingAt definitionally and specializes CMP122 Theorem 1 to the raw CMP119 state. Round217 splits raw objects from predicate vocabulary. CMP119 regular-E -> CMP109/116 and regular-E -> BC1 continuations are already compiler-closed after source realization."
  "Follow the CMP119 primary source from Eq.(2.23) into the actual rho_k/background/fluctuation/Wilson/E/R/B/vacuum objects, then bind the source Section-2 E/R/B/background predicates and quantitative norm meanings to those SAME objects. Only then continue to selected semantics / CombinedRG / BC1."
  "Published finite-cutoff UV stability is not continuum YM. A source citation is not a literal raw object; six scalar projections are not the source state; QID/DOI/Dewey are not proof."

  "Exclude every high off-line zero on the actual universal pole-quotient response, then combine with the independent low/critical bridge."
  "Preferred route: transport the already checked every-cutoff near/far + far-shell theorem onto the exact Agda carrier; attach the actual universal-pole-quotient finite-near representation; then prove the phase-preserving signed near/off payment and same-taper Gamma precision below actual ClusterResponse."
  "Lean already owns the every-J split, explicit far-shell modulus, finite near carrier and literal D_off cutoff transport; generic target translation/modulation/cosine is compiler output. The 8889 cluster margin is an optional lower-envelope donor, not a primitive in the newest direct route."
  "Follow FinalNearLiteralKernel -> ExplicitCutoffNearFarAgdaTransport -> ExplicitCutoffCarrierLeanReturn before searching new analysis. After same-object transport, the fresh zero-side analytic field is the signed finite near payment. Search the pole-taper construction and Gamma response only by exact carrier/output shape."
  "The Agda Lean-return receipt is provenance, not transported proof. Do not resurrect absolute-W(t), an intermediate cluster margin, a selected Weil window, or determinant-q payment as mandatory architecture. RH remains unproved."
