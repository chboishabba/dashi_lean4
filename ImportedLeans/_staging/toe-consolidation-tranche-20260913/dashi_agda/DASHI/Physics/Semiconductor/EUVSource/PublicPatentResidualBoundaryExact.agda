-- The important epistemic split for EUV-source engineering is not simply
-- public vs secret.  Patent disclosures are public, but a disclosed embodiment
-- does not establish that a current production source uses that exact design.
-- Conversely, lack of public disclosure does not prove that a detail is a
-- legally protected trade secret.  This finite carrier keeps those cases apart.
