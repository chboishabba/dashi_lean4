# Changelog

This changelog is append-only. Older mentions of `false` are historical wave
records unless the entry explicitly states it is describing the current live
monitor surface.

## Current Tranche Closure Snapshot

- NS Gate 2-A boolean-map and quarter-margin doc sync for `2026-07-02`:
  updated `docs/ns_triad_kn_gate2a_near_extremizer_transport_target.md`,
  `docs/ns_triad_kn_gate2_seam_to_leakage_transfer.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so the docs now match the live Agda surfaces.
  The written state now explicitly records the abstract/concrete split for
  Lemmas A/B/C, identifies the highest-alpha false booleans in the defect
  chain, and corrects the implementation order: first the concrete
  near-extremizer defect estimates, then the NS-seam realization of cone-width
  scaling and quarter-margin compatibility, then the cone-budget and
  quotient-aware transport consumers, and only then EP4 and the full
  seam-to-leakage transfer receipt. The docs also now record that EP3 is
  partially installed already: its budget decomposition booleans are true in
  `NSTriadKNGate2AEP3DirectionalTransportBudget.agda`, while the actual
  directional-budget and margin-closing booleans remain false.

- NS Gate 1 / Gate 2-A documentation and roadmap sync for `2026-07-02`:
  updated `README.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `docs/ns_triad_kn_gate2_seam_to_leakage_transfer.md` so the repo-level state
  now matches the implemented NS audit lane. The current written state is:
  Gate 1 finite-shell helical coupling evidence is repeated through
  `N = 16`; the dense OOM boundary at `N = 14` was crossed by the matrix-free
  helical certificate path; Gate 1 is now a uniform helical relative-bound
  theorem target rather than a shell-search problem; Gate 2 is the explicit
  seam-to-leakage transport theorem for the exact normalized Gram operator
  `K_N(A)`; and the first Gate 2-A comparison audit between `Schur(L_abs)` /
  `Schur(L_neg)` and seam `L_good` / `L_bad` is installed but remains
  fail-closed. No promotion changed: Gate 1 uniformity is still open, Gate 2
  transport is still open, GPU/Vulkan remains scout-only, and no NS/Clay
  authority surface moved.

- NS Gate 2-A comparison result sync for `2026-07-02`:
  updated `docs/ns_triad_kn_gate2a_normalized_carrier_agreement.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` after the first dense comparison run
  on `N = 6, 8, 10`. The new result is sharp: exact restriction identity was
  not observed, and Schur linearity was not observed, so the naive equality
  route is dead on tested dense shells. But two-sided quadratic-form
  comparability was observed on all three shells, so Gate 2-A remains live as a
  comparison-constant theorem. The current written roadmap now reflects that
  shift explicitly: stop treating exact identity as the default next proof
  route, formalize the comparison constants instead, and then carry them into a
  transport-margin ledger for `K_N(A)`.

- NS Gate 2 coarse-transport failure and sharper-ansatz sync for `2026-07-02`:
  updated `docs/ns_triad_kn_gate2a_normalized_carrier_agreement.md`,
  `docs/ns_triad_kn_gate2_seam_to_leakage_transfer.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`, and extended
  `scripts/ns_triad_kn_cross_shell_schur_symbolic_audit.py` with an
  extremizer-aware Gate 2-A transport ledger. The first coarse margin ledger on
  `N = 6, 8, 10` now records a negative result: combining seam `rho_N` with
  the worst-case quotient `C_neg^+ / c_abs^-` gives upper bounds around
  `17.7`, `17.7`, and `20.5`, so the blunt constant route cannot close Gate 2.
  The repo now records the sharper next step explicitly: pursue an
  extremizer-aware or quotient-aware transport theorem rather than the coarse
  worst-case quotient. The extremizer-aware directional ratio is also now
  recorded as the live positive signal: it stays stably near `0.168`
  (roughly `1/6`) on `N = 6, 8, 10`.

- NS Wall 1 no-triple-danger / square-wave / backward-chain tranche for
  `2026-06-23`: adds `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSNoTripleDangerBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSpectralSharpnessForkBoundary`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_no_triple_danger_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_no_triple_danger_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_square_wave_stack_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_square_wave_stack_scan.py`; strengthens
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSA9SingularityContradictionRouteBoundary`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche records the
  no-triple-danger fork explicitly as the sharper finite-dimensional Wall 1a
  target, records the spectral-sharpness / square-wave stack as the
  candidate sharpness lane that never reaches triple-danger on the attached
  adversarial scans, and rewrites the A9 singularity contradiction route as
  a backward BKM -> triad-cloud -> amplitude-fork -> triple-danger
  contradiction chain. This remains fail-closed: the new surfaces are
  empirical/candidate-only, theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false,
  and the live analytic bottleneck is still an actual proof of the
  no-triple-danger fork on genuine Biot-Savart data.

- NS Wall 1 amplitude-weighted negative-frame / energy-budgeted fork tranche
  for `2026-06-23`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSAmplitudeWeightedNegativeFrameBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadEnergyBudgetedCoherenceForkBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPointwiseTriadCloudBoundary`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_amplitude_weighted_negative_frame_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_amplitude_weighted_negative_frame_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_energy_budgeted_fork_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_energy_budgeted_fork_scan.py`; strengthens
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche records the
  amplitude-weighted operator `K_N(A)` as the next positive Wall 1 object,
  records the energy-budgeted fork
  `frame-coercive / low-band bounded / high-dissipation residence-limited`
  as the candidate Wall 1/2 bridge, records the pointwise triad-cloud
  boundary that keeps single-mode stretching zero while forcing any BKM-like
  spike to recruit a coherent triad cloud, and threads the new candidate
  surfaces through signed theorem-status, the Wall 1 shell bridge, and the
  local harness manifest. This remains fail-closed: the new surfaces are
  empirical/candidate-only, theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false,
  and Wall 1 remains unproved.

- NS Wall 1 `K_N` exact-identity / negative-frame tranche for `2026-06-23`:
  adds `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadKNExactIdentityReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadBSNegativeFrameCoercivityBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadBSSpanningLemmaReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadBSFrameEquidistributionBoundary`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_kn_exact_identity_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_kn_exact_identity_scan.py`; strengthens
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadSignedLaplacianIdentityReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_carrier_explanatory_rank_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche retires the raw
  signed-XOR route as a primary Wall 1a carrier, records the corrected
  positive-subspace identity `L_signed_norm = I - 2 K_N` as the canonical
  positive operator route, records negative-frame coercivity / spanning /
  frame-equidistribution as the candidate finite-dimensional theorem stack,
  and wires the new `K_N` surface through carrier-ranking, signed
  theorem-status, the Wall 1 shell bridge, and the local harness manifest.
  This remains fail-closed: the active archive still reports degenerate sign
  telemetry (`negative_sign_fraction_mean = 1.0` on the current local
  extraction), the new scan is empirical only, and theorem/full-NS/Clay
  promotion remain false.

- NS Wall 1 continuous coherence carrier / coherence-deficit floor tranche
  for `2026-06-23`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadContinuousCoherenceCarrierBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadCoherenceDeficitFloorBoundary`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_continuous_coherence_capacity_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_continuous_coherence_capacity_scan.py`;
  strengthens `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_carrier_explanatory_rank_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_carrier_explanatory_rank_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche records the
  continuous triadic coherence carrier as the positive Wall 1a candidate
  route after the raw signed-XOR reduction failed on the active shell
  extraction, records the coherence-deficit floor implication
  `cap_N <= kappa < 1 -> floor >= (1 - kappa) / 2` as shape only, derives a
  fail-closed continuous-capacity surface from the existing floor telemetry,
  and threads that route through carrier-ranking, signed theorem-status, the
  shell bridge, and the local harness manifest. This remains fail-closed:
  theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false, the new continuous route
  is candidate-only, its current telemetry is derived rather than an
  independent certificate, and the first live Wall 1 theorem bottleneck is
  still a real continuous coherence bound on the active shell carrier.

- NS Wall 1 signed carrier reconciliation / carrier-identification tranche
  for `2026-06-22`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadSignedCarrierReconciliationBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadWall1CarrierIdentificationBoundary`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_carrier_reconciliation_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_carrier_reconciliation_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_carrier_explanatory_rank_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_carrier_explanatory_rank_scan.py`;
  strengthens `scripts/ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche records the signed
  carrier reconciliation problem explicitly, records corrected carrier
  identification as the new first Wall 1 theorem bottleneck, reconciles the
  repo-local theorem-status CSV against the active signed gaugeability and
  signed spectral extractions, and ranks the current carrier candidates by
  explanatory support relative to the observed floor. The resulting telemetry
  is fail-closed and harsh: the repo-local signed chart agrees with the
  active negative extraction, the cycle-family route explains only about
  `0.0202` of the observed floor, the raw signed-XOR route explains `0`, and
  the current signed-spectral route explains `0`. This sharpens the live Wall
  1 bottleneck without promoting anything: theorem promotion and Clay
  promotion stay false, corrected carrier identification remains open, and
  the signed discrete/spectral routes remain insufficient on the active shell
  extraction.

- Stage12 p13 witness-row generalization for `2026-06-22`: extends
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeSuccessorWitness` with the explicit
  `canonicalStage12SuccessorWitness` row, adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.P13UnitGroupC12Witness`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.P13HexTruthActionQuotient`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.P13UnitActionTreeIsometry`,
  `DASHI.Core.P13EquivariantOddFieldGate`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.P13Stage12C12Regression`, and
  `DASHI.Interop.P13PrimeLaneStage12ActionBridge`, and generalizes
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionAdapter`,
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionAdapterRegistry`,
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionCarryBridge`,
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionSuccessorBridge`, and
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionRegression` so `p13` consumes the same
  shared Stage12 adapter story as `p7` and `p11`. `Stage12FibreSurface`
  remains the spine, `p13` is the first full `12 -> 13` witness row over that
  spine, and all authority remains candidate-only/fail-closed.

- NS quantitative cycle-defect lower-bound tranche for `2026-06-22`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadCycleDefectLowerBoundReceipt`; strengthens
  `scripts/ns_triad_cocycle_floor_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_cocycle_floor_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_frame_stability_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_frame_stability_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`; and keeps the new
  surfaces staged in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records the
  exact cycle-defect lower-bound law
  `F_N(psi) >= (4 / pi^2) * Delta_n(psi)^2 / sum(n_e^2 / w_e)` as a
  fail-closed receipt, swaps floating nullspace witnesses for integer
  cycle-basis witnesses on the shell carrier, and adds normalized lower-bound
  support telemetry against the optimized Wall 1 phase-gap surface. This
  remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false, no
  uniform cocycle floor theorem is proved, no floor-to-frame theorem is
  proved, and the strengthened scans are empirical only.

- NS Wall 1 cycle-family packing / K01 geometry tranche for `2026-06-22`:
  adds `scripts/ns_triad_cycle_packing_overlap_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_cycle_packing_overlap_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_k01_geometry_audit_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_k01_geometry_audit_scan.py`; sharpens
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadCycleFamilyLowerBoundBoundary` and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSchurComplementFrameGapBoundary`; strengthens
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche records the
  cycle-family packing/overlap surface as a candidate-only empirical audit of
  obstruction-direction collapse versus spread, records a candidate-only K01
  geometry audit around shell ratio / angular mismatch / coupling
  concentration proxies, wires both into the Wall 1 shell bridge and local
  harness manifest, and tightens the Agda boundary language around the
  family quadratic obstruction and the non-adversarial `K01 / Schur` bridge.
  This remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false,
  the cycle-family lower-bound theorem is not proved, the non-adversarial
  Schur gap is not proved, and the new scans are empirical only.

- NS Wall 1 signed-XOR / signed-spectrum correction tranche for `2026-06-22`:
  adds `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadSignedXORGaugeabilityBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadSignedSpectralFrustrationBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadSignedLaplacianIdentityReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadSignedLaplacianSpectrumAuditReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_xor_gaugeability_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_xor_gaugeability_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_spectral_audit_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_spectral_audit_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_signed_wall1_theorem_status.py`; strengthens
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`. The tranche records signed
  balance-versus-gaugeability as a candidate-only Wall 1a surface, records
  the signed-Laplacian / `I - K_N` identity only as an audited receipt with
  explicit endpoint-confusion guards, and wires a signed theorem-status
  summary into the Wall 1 shell bridge. The resulting telemetry is sharply
  negative and fail-closed on the active shell carrier: the signed mod-2 XOR
  surface is gaugeable (`signed_xor_weighted_distance_fraction_mean = 0`),
  while the candidate signed-Laplacian proxy is not the same operator as
  `I - K_N` (`identity_error_op_mean ≈ 7.42e25`,
  `xy_floor_spectral_lower_bound_mean = 0`). This sharpens the live
  bottleneck without promoting anything: theorem promotion and Clay
  promotion stay false, signed non-gaugeability is not proved, and the
  signed spectral route remains unproved.

- NS Wall 1 phase-regime / cocycle-floor / floor-to-frame tranche for
  `2026-06-22`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPhaseRegimeSeparationBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadCocycleFrustrationFloorBoundary`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSFloorToFrameStabilityBoundary`; adds
  `scripts/ns_triad_phase_regime_separation_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_phase_regime_separation_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_frame_stability_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_frame_stability_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_cocycle_floor_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_cocycle_floor_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_wall1_shell_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the new
  scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records
  shellwise random-phase versus optimized low-frustration telemetry as a
  candidate-only phase-regime boundary, records the explicit cocycle-floor
  target around cycle-defect lower-bound proxies and irreducible floor
  telemetry, and records the floor-to-frame stability warning that a scalar
  floor alone does not imply `K_N < 1`. This remains fail-closed: theorem
  promotion and Clay promotion stay false, the cocycle-floor theorem is not
  proved, the floor-to-frame bridge is not proved, and the new scans are
  empirical only.

- NS Wall 1 entropy-barrier / Wall 2 residence-compression tranche for
  `2026-06-22`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadEntropyBarrierTheoremBoundary` and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadResidenceTimeCompressionBoundary`; adds
  `scripts/ns_triad_cycle_obstruction_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_cycle_obstruction_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_low_frustration_hessian_scan.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_low_frustration_hessian_scan.py`; and stages the
  new scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche
  records the explicit Wall 1 entropy-barrier theorem boundary around
  low-frustration basin volume, Hessian expansion, and determinant lower-bound
  dependencies; records the explicit Wall 2 residence-time compression
  boundary around low-frustration basin residence, cosphere
  transport-dissipation, and the non-Sobolev bridge requirement; and adds new
  empirical telemetry for cycle-rank proxies, cocycle residues, exact-lock
  scores, and Hessian-style low-frustration basin proxies on the shared raw
  N128 archive. This remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay
  promotion stay false, the entropy-barrier theorem is not proved,
  residence-time exclusion is not proved, and the new scans are empirical
  only.

- NS triad incidence / frustration / adversarial-reference tranche for
  `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadIncidenceCocycleReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadKernelPhaseCocycleReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadFrustrationDefectBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSAdversarialGibbsPhaseReferenceReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSacasaTriadFrustrationBridgeBoundary`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadFrustrationRegression`; adds
  `scripts/ns_triad_incidence_cocycle_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_incidence_cocycle_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_frustration_defect_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_frustration_defect_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_adversarial_phase_reference_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_adversarial_phase_reference_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_triad_frustration_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_triad_frustration_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the new
  scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records
  the explicit triad-incidence carrier `B`, the kernel-phase cocycle target
  `B phi = psi`, the weighted frustration-defect boundary
  `F_N(psi) = inf_phi ||B phi - psi||^2`, the regularized adversarial Gibbs
  reference, and the fail-closed Sacasa->Kiriukhin bridge boundary that
  keeps orbit-to-cosphere identification, realization-level `|V_N| <= C_N`,
  and integrable `sup_N C_N` all explicitly open. It also adds empirical
  telemetry for carrier density, cycle-rank proxies, exact-lock scores,
  frustration residuals, coherence-loss proxies, adversarial phase gain over
  the zero reference, and a compact bridge summary over the shared raw N128
  frames. This remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay
  false, the bridge theorem is not proved, and the new scans are empirical
  only.

- Generic quotient-action and p11 second-lane tranche for `2026-06-22`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.PrimeLaneUnitActionQuotient`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.P11UnitGroupC10Witness`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.P11HexTruthActionQuotient`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.P11UnitActionTreeIsometry`,
  `DASHI.Core.P11EquivariantOddFieldGate`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.P11Stage11C10Regression`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche generalizes the local prime-lane quotient
  surface beyond the p7-only exemplar, adds a concrete `p11 / C10` witness
  with Stage-11 identity and Stage-10 unit-order receipts, threads that lane
  through canonical address/depth self-isometry and odd-field equivariance
  consumers, and keeps the reduced HexTruth transport honest by recording the
  p11 half-turn as a fail-closed transport quotient rather than a clean
  group-faithful action. This remains candidate-only and fail-closed: no
  all-primes `(\u2124/p\u2124)^×` action theorem, analytic BT/p-adic symmetry
  dynamics, or Clay authority is promoted.

- NS Sacasa/Kiriukhin orbit-coherence bridge tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSKiriukhinOrbitStretchingCarrierReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSacasaCosphereCoherenceCarrierReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSacasaKiriukhinIdentificationBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSNonSobolevBridgeNoCircularityGate`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadPhaseLockingLiveWallReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_orbit_phase_coherence_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_orbit_phase_coherence_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_non_sobolev_coherence_gate_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_non_sobolev_coherence_gate_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sacasa_kiriukhin_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_sacasa_kiriukhin_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the new
  scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records
  the Kiriukhin orbit-level stretching matrix `V_N` as a model-only carrier,
  records the Sacasa cosphere bundle / directional energy / angular entropy /
  dissipation route as a candidate-only coherence carrier, records the
  explicit no-circularity gate against `H^s(s>2)`-only / expectation-only /
  model-only shortcuts, and isolates the live wall as realization-level
  triadic phase-locking exclusion via a genuinely non-Sobolev coherence
  bound. It also adds empirical telemetry for selected-mode resonant
  orbit-phase coherence, same-amplitude phase-shuffled non-Sobolev gap
  proxies, and a compact bridge summary over the shared raw N128 frames. This
  remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false, the
  Sacasa-Kiriukhin bridge is not proved, continuation closure is not proved,
  and the new scans are empirical only.

- NS tube-morphology / boundary-helicity Route 1 tranche for `2026-06-21`:
  adds `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTubeMorphologyForcedLocalizationRouteAuditReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSingleTubePressureCaseExclusionReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBoundaryHelicityQSignBridgeReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_tube_morphology_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_tube_morphology_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_helicity_q_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_helicity_q_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_tube_pressure_helicity_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_tube_pressure_helicity_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the
  new scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche
  records the fail-closed Route 1 tube-morphology / forced-localization audit
  surface, a straight-tube versus curved-tube non-promoting pressure-case
  ledger, and the boundary helicity / `Q` sign bridge as an observed or
  external route only. It also adds empirical telemetry for high-enstrophy
  tube/sheet/blob proxies, boundary-band helicity versus `Q` sign/co-movement,
  and a compact framewise bridge back to the existing boundary pressure scan.
  This remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false,
  tube morphology is not proved, helicity-to-`Q` sign control is not proved,
  and the new scans are empirical only.

- NS boundary pressure-gate / Route 1 audit tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBoundaryDelta1LevelSetEvolutionReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressureRieszCompatibilityReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressureQObservableRouteAuditReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_boundary_pressure_gate_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_pressure_gate_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_pressure_q_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_pressure_q_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the
  new scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche
  records the fail-closed Route 1 boundary level-set `delta1` evolution
  ledger, the torus pressure/Riesz compatibility route
  `-Delta p = h`, `h = ||S||_F^2 - |omega|^2/2`, `integral h = 0`, and the
  `Q = <e2, Hess p e1>` / `I_Q` observable audit as the live sign gate. It
  also adds empirical boundary-band telemetry for `P11/P22/P33/Q` and a
  compact bridge to the existing boundary-`delta1` and pressure-gap scans on
  the raw N128 archive. This remains fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay
  promotion stay false, pressure-sign control is not proved, and the new
  scans are empirical only.

- NS Case A / boundary-`delta1` geometric tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDelta1BoundaryNormIdentityReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSZeroBoundaryGenericityReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDeterminantConcentrationImpossibilityReceipt`;
  adds `scripts/ns_case_a_transition_shell_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_case_a_transition_shell_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_delta1_uniformity_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_delta1_uniformity_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_case_a_geometric_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_case_a_geometric_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the new
  scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records
  the exact boundary-side `delta1` norm identity ledger on `dOmega_K`,
  records the `S=0` subset/genericity route around the boundary gate,
  records the determinant-side Case B / bounded-concentration impossibility
  rows, and adds empirical transition-shell, boundary-gap, and
  boundary-`delta1` telemetry on the raw N128 archive. This remains
  fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false, Case A
  co-area/trace closure is not proved, pressure-correction sign control is
  not proved, and the boundary-`delta1` lower bound is empirical only.

- NS pressure-correction / uniform-`delta1` reduction tranche for
  `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressureCorrectionEigenframeScaleReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSCompressiveZonePiDecompositionReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDelta1UniformGateReductionReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_pressure_eigenframe_gap_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_pressure_eigenframe_gap_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_compressive_pi_decomposition_scan.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_compressive_pi_decomposition_scan.py`,
  `scripts/ns_alignment_pressure_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_alignment_pressure_bridge_summary.py`; and stages the new
  scan/check surfaces in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records
  the pressure-correction scale explicitly as off-diagonal pressure-Hessian
  projections divided by strain-eigenvalue gaps, records the compressive-zone
  `Pi_c` decomposition on `Omega_K^c={lambda2>=0}`, and records the reduction
  of the residual L3-a alignment obstruction to the live quantitative gate
  `delta1 >= delta0 > 0` once the alignment ODE / pressure-correction scale
  are accepted. The new telemetry joins pressure proxies, compressive Pi
  balance, and alignment-gap bins across the raw N128 frames. This remains
  fail-closed: theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false, pressure-
  correction sign control is not proved, the uniform `delta1` lower bound is
  not proved, and the new scans are empirical only.

- NS dual-dominance / exact-alignment-ODE tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSExtensionDominatesCompressionReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSVorticityStretchingExactReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSAlignmentProjectionODEReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSEulerAlignmentGapControlReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSResidualAlignmentObstructionHierarchyReceipt`;
  adds `scripts/ns_alignment_gap_bin_scan.py` and
  `scripts/check_ns_alignment_gap_bin_scan.py`; and stages the new scan/check
  pair in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records exact
  extensional dominance on `Omega_K`, exact `Dt omega = S·omega`
  antisymmetric cancellation, the eigenframe projection ODE with explicit
  rotation cancellation, the conditional Euler-limit gap-control route, and
  the sharpened `R1/R2/R3` residual hierarchy. This remains fail-closed:
  theorem promotion and Clay promotion stay false, the pressure-correction
  sign gate is not closed, the uniform `delta1` lower bound remains open,
  and the gap-bin scan is empirical telemetry only.

- NS strain-type-I / pressure-factor / alignment-obstruction tranche for
  `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressurePoissonIdentityCorrectionReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSCompressionDominatesExtensionReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSStrainTypeIOmegaKPositiveReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBkTrajectoryMinimumReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSVorticityAlignmentObstructionReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_vorticity_alignment_obstruction_scan.py` and
  `scripts/check_ns_vorticity_alignment_obstruction_scan.py`; and stages the
  new scan/check pair in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche records
  the corrected pressure identity factor `-Delta p = tr(S^2) - |omega|^2/2`
  together with `Delta p = 2 Qvel`, the algebraic compression-dominates-
  extension lemma on `{lambda2S>=0}`, the Level-2 corrected route
  `Miller + strain-type-I => |Omega_K(t)| > 0`, the `B_k = 0` trajectory-
  minimum second-variation reading, and the vorticity-alignment obstruction
  that leaves misaligned vorticity in the compressive zone as the residual
  sign gate. This is fail-closed bookkeeping only: theorem promotion, Clay
  promotion, quantitative `delta1`, and strict `H_B` remain open/false, and
  the alignment scan is empirical rather than theorem-bearing.

- Typed SSP/Base369 odd-lane spine tranche for `2026-06-20`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPTritCarrier`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.FifteenSSPSurface`,
  `DASHI.Core.SuperSSPOddPayload`,
  `DASHI.Core.OddSSPCoefficientGate`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.HexTruthPolarityFactor`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.StageAtlasZeroToEleven`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.NumberRoleBoundary`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche replaces the loose odd-lane coefficient
  story with a typed spine: `SSPTrit = {-1,0,+1}`, `15SSP[-1,0,1]` as the
  15-lane residual surface, `SuperSSP` as `A + B theta` with typed even body
  and odd residue, the one-generator collapse
  `oddCoeff = oddDerivative = berezinIntegral`, `HexTruth ≅ TriTruth ×
  Polarity`, a spiral-aware `0..11` stage atlas, and an explicit number-role
  boundary separating algebra, coordinate, phase, transport, and mnemonic
  readings. This remains candidate-only and fail-closed: no supergeometry,
  topology, ontology, or Clay authority is promoted.

- Prime-lane `369` depth/ultrametric tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLane369Signature`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLane369Refinement`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.FifteenSSP369Forest`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.SSP369Ultrametric`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLaneSymmetryProfile`, and
  `DASHI.Core.SuperSSP369Field`, wired through `DASHI.Everything`. The
  tranche records typed per-prime `mod [3,6,9]` fingerprints for the 15 SSP
  lanes, recursive depth-refined `369` addresses, the 15-lane refinement
  forest, prefix-agreement ultrametric geometry, local symmetry profiles with
  both prime-identity and unit-order stage readings, and a typed supervoxel
  field lift over that carrier stack. This remains candidate-only and
  fail-closed: it sharpens the carrier geometry without promoting p-adic,
  BT-tree, wavefield, or Clay authority.

- Prime-lane bridge-consumer tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPBase369Bridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369BTBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369PAdicBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369PhaseBridge`,
  `DASHI.Core.OddSSP369FieldGate`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLane369BridgeRegression`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche turns the new carrier stack into live
  consumers: 15SSP surfaces now admit typed Base369 readouts, prime lanes now
  admit typed BT valencies and finite p-adic coordinate witnesses, phase/stage
  consumers now receive a unified typed seam, the field lift now participates
  in odd extraction, and one compact regression surface ties canonical p7/p11/
  p71 and root/depth3 examples together. This remains candidate-only and
  fail-closed: no analytic p-adic completion, continuum BT authority, phase
  promotion, or Clay authority is claimed.

- Prime-lane bridge-consumer deepening tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369ResidueFactorBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369DepthPhaseBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369BTUltrametricBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369FieldPhaseBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369PAdicUltrametricBridge`,
  `DASHI.Core.OddSSP369FocusedPrimeGate`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLane369ConsumerRegression`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche deepens the consumer side of the SSP/369
  stack: per-prime signatures now admit explicit residue-factor consumers,
  depth-indexed 369 refinements now feed typed stage-atlas readings, BT
  profiles now share a prefix-ultrametric seam, field focus now admits typed
  phase and Base369 surface readouts, finite p-adic coordinates now share the
  same address geometry, focused odd extraction now exposes the prime-lane
  supervoxel seam directly, and one compact regression surface packages the
  canonical p3/p7/p11 and root/depth3 witnesses. This remains candidate-only
  and fail-closed: no analytic p-adic completion, continuum BT authority,
  phase promotion, or Clay authority is claimed.

- Prime-lane symmetry-action tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLaneUnitAction`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.SSP369TreeAutomorphism`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.SSP369SymmetryIsometry`,
  `DASHI.Core.SuperSSP369EquivariantOddGate`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SSPPrimeLane369ActionPhaseBridge`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLaneUnitActionRegression`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche upgrades the prior static symmetry-profile
  lane into finite local action receipts: each tracked prime lane now admits
  a typed unit-action step, an induced rotation on `369` digits and hex
  phase/polarity, tree/prefix compatibility over depth-refined addresses,
  self-isometry receipts on the shared ultrametric geometry, an equivariant
  odd-field extraction seam on the focused supervoxel carrier, and one compact
  regression surface tying canonical `p7`/`p11` and root/depth3 witnesses
  together. This remains candidate-only and fail-closed: no full
  `(\u2124/p\u2124)^×` action, analytic p-adic dynamics, continuum BT
  symmetry authority, or Clay promotion is claimed.

- P7 quotient-action exemplar tranche for `2026-06-21`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SSPPrimeLaneUnitGroup`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.P7UnitGroupC6Witness`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.P7HexTruthActionQuotient`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.P7UnitActionTreeIsometry`,
  `DASHI.Core.P7EquivariantOddFieldGate`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.P7Stage7C6HexRegression`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche upgrades the p7 lane from a generic
  step-transport receipt into a typed `C6` quotient exemplar with explicit
  identity, generator, inverse, and Möbius elements; explicit Stage-7 /
  Stage-6 witness rows; p7-specific HexTruth/Möbius transport receipts;
  p7-specific canonical-address tree/depth self-isometry receipts; and
  p7-specific odd-field equivariance receipts. This remains candidate-only
  and fail-closed: it does not promote a full general `(\u2124/p\u2124)^×`
  action, analytic BT/p-adic symmetry dynamics, or any Clay authority.

- Stage12 prime-lane hierarchy update for `2026-06-22`: adds
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionAdapter`, wires it through
  `DASHI.Everything`, and reclassifies the p7 tranche as the first canonical
  prime-local `C6` / `HexTruth` witness under `Stage12FibreSurface` rather
  than as a parallel stage spine. The adapter binds the p7 witness to the
  global `atlas-7`, `atlas-6`, and `atlas-11 / rev-2` Stage12 receipts while
  preserving candidate-only and fail-closed governance.

- Stage12 adapter generalization update for `2026-06-22`: extends
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionAdapter` so the shared adapter contract
  admits both canonical `p7` and `p11` rows, adds
  `DASHI.Interop.P7PrimeLaneStage12ActionBridge`,
  `DASHI.Interop.P11PrimeLaneStage12ActionBridge`,
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionAdapterRegistry`,
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionCarryBridge`,
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionSuccessorBridge`, and
  `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionRegression`, and wires them through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The route now makes `p11` consume the same Stage12
  prime-lane adapter story as `p7`, keeps `atlas-11 / rev-2` as the shared
  carry-depth seam, and enumerates the canonical adapter set without
  promoting any new stage-spine or universal-prime authority.

- Odd-lane / Möbius / Klein / Hodge / Base369 intake tranche for
  `2026-06-20`: adds `DASHI.Core.SuperPayloadReadingBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Core.OddGrassmannCoefficientGate`,
  `DASHI.Core.OddBerezinTopCoefficientBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.MobiusOrientationGate`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.KleinClosureReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.KleinHodgeDualityBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369MobiusTransport`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369MobiusTransportRegression`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records `R^{p|q}` as even carrier body plus
  odd nilpotent witness lanes, the one-generator collapse
  `∂_θ = ∫ dθ = [θ]` at the coefficient-extraction surface, the `q > 1`
  ordered top-coefficient/sign-convention boundary, the Möbius one-loop
  orientation flip and Klein two-band non-orientable closure, the
  metric-plus-orientation gate for ordinary global Hodge duality with torus
  double-cover / twisted repair candidates, and the Base369 mod-6 transport
  `k ↦ k + 3` that preserves triadic phase while flipping polarity. This is
  candidate-only and fail-closed: semantic, proof, measure, and promotion
  authority remain false.

- Sharp conditional TheoremG exponent-comparison tranche for `2026-06-20`:
  updates
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSConditionalQGronwallTheoremGReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTheoremGCancellationUpgradeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSCollapseConditionalGronwallBridgeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTheoremGQ2GD1ContradictionChannelReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSKatoHessianConfinementReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_theoremg_sharp_conditional_summary.py` and
  `scripts/check_ns_theoremg_sharp_conditional_summary.py`; updates
  `scripts/check_ns_theoremg_q2_gd1_contradiction_channel.py` and the local
  Clay harness manifest discovery surface. The theorem route now records
  exact `lambda2 = 0` stretching cancellation, an enstrophy-driven source
  lane, open sharp hypotheses `(H_B)`, `(H_area)`, `(H_g12++)`, and the
  exponent-comparison contradiction route
  `(T*-t)^(-2)` versus `(T*-t)^(-2/delta1)` with gate `delta1 > 1`, while
  rejecting the older uniform energy-only source story. The CSV-backed
  summary over the supplied 13 frames records
  `H_area_direct_min = 0.696366`, `H_area_isop_lower_min = 7.6445`,
  `H_B_rho_min = 0.231`, `H_g12_min = 1.4216`, `delta1_min = 1.4303`, and
  exponent margin `0.601691952737188`. This is fail-closed bookkeeping only:
  contradiction discharge remains false, `collapseImpossible` remains false,
  full NS Clay remains false, and Clay promotion remains false.

- NS determinant-ledger correction tranche for `2026-06-20`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBetchovDeterminantIdentityReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDeterminantSignRuleReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBetchovBKMPositiveMeasureReceipt`; rewrites
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDelta1BoundaryStrainGateReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSharpTheoremGHierarchyReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSQCriterionZeroMeanIdentityReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTypeIHAreaUniformizationReceipt`; adds
  `scripts/ns_betchov_determinant_sign_scan.py` and
  `scripts/check_ns_betchov_determinant_sign_scan.py`; and stages the new
  scan/check pair in the local Clay harness manifest. The tranche corrects
  the old `Qvel -> Omega_K` overreach: `Qvel` now remains a ledger only for
  `Omega_Q={Qvel>0}`, while the strain route is rebuilt around
  `∫ det(S) = -Pi/4`, the sign rule
  `{lambda2S<0}={det(S)>0}` / `{lambda2S>0}={det(S)<0}`, the unconditional
  near-blow-up positive-measure result for `{lambda2S>0}`, and the Sard
  partial closure `delta1>0` a.e. on `dOmega_K`. This remains fail-closed:
  `delta1>=1`, strict `H_B`, and determinant-side `H_area` lower bounds are
  still open, and no Clay promotion is claimed.

- NS broad-tube conditional regularization tranche for `2026-06-20`: stages
  discovery-only local Clay manifest entries for
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeNondegenerateGradientReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeVorticityCoverageReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeSerrinExponentDischargeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeConditionalRegularityTheoremReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_broad_tube_conditional_regularization_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_broad_tube_conditional_regularization_summary.py`. This
  is fail-closed bookkeeping only; full NS Clay and Clay promotion remain
  false. The current proof-kernel blockers are still explicit: no
  unconditional lambda2-gradient theorem, strict-carrier insufficiency /
  `broad_tube_required`, no unconditional Serrin bound, and
  `unconditionalClayNS=false` with `clayPromotion=false`.

- NS broad-tube coarea / Serrin lift / BKM bridge implementation tranche for
  `2026-06-20`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeCoareaBridgeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeSerrinLiftReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeBKMBridgeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeSerrinBKMCompositeReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_broad_tube_serrin_bkm_bridge_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_broad_tube_serrin_bkm_bridge_summary.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and optional local Clay harness discovery. The three
  requested gates are now checked conditional sockets and the composite
  receipt records `broadTubeCoarea -> Serrin lift -> BKM bridge ->
  conditional no-blowup socket`. This is fail-closed: the hypotheses are
  explicit, unconditional BKM/Clay closure is not asserted, full NS Clay and
  `clayPromotion` remain false.

- NS Shahmurov two-paper claim intake / broad-tube Serrin gap tranche for
  `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSShahmurovTwoPaperClaimIntakeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBroadTubeSerrinLiftGapReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_shahmurov_claim_intake.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_shahmurov_claim_intake_regression.py`; updates
  `scripts/ns_lambda2_carrier_route_summary.py` and the optional local Clay
  harness manifest. The Shahmurov lane records arXiv `2605.01875` and
  `2605.01873` as external preprint-claim intake only. It is fail-closed:
  peer-review verification, Dashi route supersession, theorem promotion, full
  NS Clay, and Clay promotion remain false. The internal Dashi route is still
  `broad_tube_required`, with strict carrier insufficiency recorded and the
  remaining broad-tube coarea, Serrin lift, and BKM bridge obligations open.

- NS pressure-convention normalization tranche for `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressurePoissonConventionNormalizationReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_pressure_poisson_sign_timeseries_audit.py`,
  `scripts/ns_raw_derived_tensor_convention_compare.py`,
  `scripts/ns_interior_budget_timeseries_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_pressure_poisson_bypass_convention_normalized.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_pressure_convention_regression.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and optional local Clay harness surfaces. Across all
  13 raw-gradient frames the sign audit selects `+Delta p`, with scale
  min/mean/max `0.17270948315397366 / 0.17532485071188417 /
  0.17672763906546698`; frame-10 raw/derived comparison records a 2-of-3
  `lambda2` sign mismatch and large `g12` convention drift; interior-budget
  telemetry records signed-budget min/mean/max
  `-237921.7614255873 / 186923.52795757324 / 612014.7221483203`. The
  convention-normalized component-2 pressure bypass has 78 of 162 pointwise
  violations under the audit-selected plus convention versus 11 of 162 under
  the legacy absolute-Delta proxy. This is fail-closed: sign choice does not
  validate the pressure bypass, and convention normalization, raw/derived
  tensor reconciliation, pressure-CZ, the interior maximum principle, full NS
  Clay, and Clay promotion remain open/false.

- NS interior pressure-mediated vorticity tranche for `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSInteriorVorticityMaxPrincipleReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressureCZEnstrophyClosureReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_interior_vorticity_budget_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_omega_l3_timeseries_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_pressure_poisson_sign_audit.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_interior_pressure_regression.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and the optional local Clay harness manifest. Calc 6 at
  the frame-10 worst-vorticity cell `[9,71,29]` records raw-gradient
  `lambda2 = 1.6119109128727063`, `lambda3 = 29.848578811173127`,
  `omega_norm_sq = 12388.906932970465`, signed budget
  `334772.5798298581`, and `Delta p = 5986.202503491044`. Calc 7 records
  finite omega-L3 domain norms across 13 frames with min/mean/max
  `219.35581815648177 / 244.53448709725947 / 273.5247888329034`. The
  pressure-Poisson sign audit prefers `+Delta p` with best scale
  `0.1760513397665311`, so the prior pressure-bypass violations are recorded
  as a convention/sign issue to resolve, not as a closed pressure proof. This
  tranche remains empirical and fail-closed: the interior maximum principle,
  pressure-CZ bound, enstrophy/BKM bridge, full NS Clay, and Clay promotion
  remain false/open.

- NS pressure-Poisson bypass / Q3 threshold / geometric concentration tranche
  for `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSPressurePoissonBypassReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSQ3ExtensionalThresholdReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSGeometricConcentrationCarrierReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_pressure_poisson_bypass_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_geometric_concentration_diagnostic.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_boundary_g12_bounds_diagnostic.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_pressure_geometric_regression.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and optional local Clay harness surfaces. The tranche
  records the pressure-Poisson bypass inequality, the Q3 extensional
  threshold wall, and the single remaining geometric concentration obstruction
  as fail-closed route surfaces. Frame-10 N128 telemetry records finite
  component-2 pressure-bypass fields but 11 pointwise
  `omega_norm_sq > rhs_proxy` violations; the top-0.1% vorticity concentration
  diagnostic places only about 0.143% of top cells on the `|lambda2| <= 1e-3`
  carrier and the worst vorticity cell off-carrier. This is adverse evidence
  for the naive geometric concentration conjecture at this frame. The same
  frame records global `g12_min = 0.009662386196279904` and
  `g12_max = 73.80437777669184`. It is empirical/analytic-route bookkeeping
  only: layer CZ/coarea, geometric concentration, BKM closure,
  `collapseImpossible`, full NS Clay, and Clay promotion remain false.

- NS biaxial-cancellation / GD1 no-collapse / LayerKorn literature tranche for
  `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBiaxialCancellationIdentityReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSGD1MinPrincipleNoLambda3CollapseReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTheoremGCancellationUpgradeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSLayerKornLiteratureClosureReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_theoremg_cancellation_margin.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_cancellation_margin_regression.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and the optional local Clay harness manifest.  The tranche
  records the exact biaxial cancellation identity on `lambda2=0`, the
  cancellation-upgraded Theorem G shape with `mu_cancellation = delta1`, the
  GD1 two-regime minimum-principle route, and the LayerKorn literature route.
  It is fail-closed: exact constants, GD1 proof terms, theorem applicability,
  LayerCZ, and LayerKorn proof terms remain gated; `collapseImpossible`,
  `KornLevelSet`, full NS Clay, and Clay promotion remain false.

- NS conditional Theorem G / corrected Gronwall-margin tranche for
  `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSConditionalQGronwallTheoremGReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSCollapseConditionalGronwallBridgeReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_component_lambda3_corrected_gronwall_margin.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_timeseries_margin_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_gronwall_margin_regression.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and the optional local Clay harness manifest.  The
  frame-10 component-2 corrected margin artifact records
  `delta1 = 2.0910865534885876`,
  `mu = 3.703952825596815`, and F123 signed damping sum
  `-8437.74113479362`.  This is conditional and empirical/non-promoting:
  the route is `h_delta1 + TheoremG -> collapseImpossible_conditional`
  only, positive commutator measurement is still unavailable, and
  `h_delta1`, unconditional `collapseImpossible`, `KornLevelSet`, full NS
  Clay, and Clay promotion remain open/false.

- NS boundary lambda3/F123 empirical tranche for `2026-06-19`: adds
  `scripts/ns_boundary_component_lambda3_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_f123_absorption_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_boundary_empirical_summary.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_boundary_empirical_regression.py`, and the fail-closed
  receipt `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSBoundaryLambda3F123EmpiricalReceipt`, wired
  through `DASHI.Everything`. The frame-10 component-2 N128 artifacts record
  `lambda3_min = 2.0910865534885876` on the 162-cell boundary band and F123
  signed damping sum `-8437.74113479362`; positive commutator comparison
  remains unavailable. The tranche is empirical/non-promoting only:
  `h_delta1`, `KornLevelSet`, `collapseImpossible`, full NS Clay, and Clay
  promotion remain open/false.

- Calc 8 layer L2 vorticity fraction tranche for `2026-06-19`: records the
  layer-L2 vorticity fraction diagnostic as empirical/non-promoting via
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSLayerL2VorticityFractionReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_layer_l2_vorticity_fraction_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_layer_l2_vorticity_fraction_summary.py`, and
  `scripts/check_ns_layer_l2_vorticity_fraction_regression.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and optional local Clay harness surfaces. Over 13 N128
  frames, the fraction of total domain `sum(|omega|^2)` in
  `|lambda2| < eps` has min/mean/max
  `0.00013966842124745355 / 0.00017065548618035617 /
  0.00019310583413265837` for `eps = 0.001`,
  `0.0015262680936971556 / 0.0017215705676850985 /
  0.0019673253564923754` for `eps = 0.01`,
  `0.015319900559077077 / 0.017090189859841835 /
  0.019062833364576894` for `eps = 0.1`, and
  `0.15119918559448156 / 0.16999198817491581 /
  0.18825663224520564` for `eps = 1.0`. This is weak support for
  strict-carrier SerrinFromQ2Control and stronger only for a broad tube; no
  theorem promotion, carrier upgrade, or Clay promotion claim is made.

- NS weighted `|lambda2|` carrier quantile tranche for `2026-06-19`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSWeightedLambda2CarrierQuantileReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_weighted_lambda2_carrier_quantile_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/ns_lambda2_signed_region_partition_diagnostic.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_weighted_lambda2_carrier_quantile_regression.py`,
  `scripts/check_ns_lambda2_signed_region_partition_regression.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_lambda2_carrier_route_summary.py`, wired through
  `DASHI.Everything` and optional local Clay harness surfaces. Over 13 N128
  frames, the mean `|lambda2|` threshold needed to carry 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%,
  75%, and 90% of total `sum(|omega|^2)` is
  `0.293311984670807`, `0.5879037709216446`,
  `1.4905889778538952`, `3.1571976803596873`,
  `5.393640349722717`, and `7.7260941728276205`. Signed-region mean
  fractions are `lambda2 < 0`: `0.4881386329371345`,
  `|lambda2| <= 0.1`: `0.017090189859841835`, and
  `lambda2 > 0`: `0.5118613670628656`. The route summary is
  `broad_tube_required`: strict-carrier `SerrinFromQ2Control` remains weak
  empirical evidence only, and no theorem promotion, carrier upgrade, or Clay
  promotion claim is made.

- Formal structure/lens law tranche for `2026-06-17`: adds
  `DASHI.Core.FormalStructureLawCore`, `DASHI.Core.FormalLensLawCore`, and
  `DASHI.Core.SourceProcessEvidenceLawCore` as the candidate-only law-bearing
  socket layer above formal-lens vocabulary/qualification and source-process
  evidence. The tranche records finite-sample, vector/product, coordinate
  projection, equivalence, quotient/fiber, canonical-encoding, residue-system,
  formal-lens law, invariant/morphism, and source-process inclusion/escalation
  surfaces while keeping representation, statistic, projection, digest,
  coordinate-model, semantic, source-compromise, security, theorem, domain, and
  promotion authority blocked. Adds `scripts/run_agda29_parallel_check.sh` as
  the Agda 2.9 sibling-flake parallel shadow-tree wrapper and wires the new
  cores through `DASHI.Everything` plus reusable-core regression.

- Source-process evidence generic tranche for `2026-06-17`: adds
  `DASHI.Core.SourceProcessEvidenceCore` to `DASHI.Everything` and includes it in
  `scripts/check_reusable_core_regression.py`, with a discovery-only
  `scripts/audit_source_process_evidence_candidates.py` queue; this is reusable
  process/evidence plumbing with no promotion claims.

- Formal-lens vocabulary tranche for `2026-06-17`: adds
  `DASHI.Core.FormalLensVocabularyCore` as the broad JMD formal-lens taxonomy
  and wires the projection/hash/RSA tranche regression surfaces.

- Six-lane RSA/hash projection tranche for `2026-06-17`: adds
  `DASHI.Crypto.RSAArithmeticCore`,
  `DASHI.Crypto.RSASharedPrimeCollapse`,
  `DASHI.Crypto.RSACRTChamberCore`,
  `DASHI.Crypto.RSAKeygenTraceCore`,
  `DASHI.Core.FingerprintProjectionCore`, and
  `DASHI.Crypto.HashCandidateBoundary`. The tranche moves RSA from pure
  receipt scaffolding toward proof-shaped arithmetic, shared-factor witness,
  CRT-chamber, and keygen-trace carriers, while adding the sibling
  fingerprint/hash projection core. Full RSA correctness, gcd equality, CRT
  recombination, MD5/hash security, content-address authority, and general
  cryptographic break claims remain explicitly unpromoted.

- Six-lane RSA source-conditioned statistical/keygen tranche for `2026-06-17`:
  adds the keygen source boundary, batch shared-prime boundary, iteration leak
  boundary, and entropy-source statistical boundary as candidate-only
  bookkeeping surfaces. No RSA break, factoring claim, security theorem,
  advisory authority, or promotion authority is asserted.

- Six-lane control-card/statistics/crypto generic tranche for `2026-06-17`:
  adds `DASHI.Core.ControlCardCore` as the reusable O/R/C/S/L/P/G/F
  control-card spine, `scripts/audit_control_card_candidates.py` as the
  discovery-only ORCSLPGF/control-card migration queue, and
  `DASHI.Core.StatisticalEvidenceCore` as the candidate-only inference,
  robust-evidence, interval/test/decision, uncertainty, and residual surface.
  Adds `DASHI.Core.HiddenLiftProjectionCore` as the generic private-state to
  public-quotient/projection plus hidden-lift witness boundary, with RSA as a
  downstream instance rather than the abstraction ceiling. Adds
  `DASHI.Crypto.RSAVulnerabilityBoundary` and
  `DASHI.Crypto.RSABTResidueBraidHypervoxelBoundary` for candidate-only RSA
  vulnerability, BT residue chamber, CRT braid/fingerprint, visible-axis
  FactorVec, and hypervoxel padding/ciphertext boundary bookkeeping. These
  surfaces promote no RSA break, factoring-hardness theorem, semantic-security
  proof, padding-security proof, side-channel/implementation authority,
  theorem authority, statistical truth/certainty, or governance promotion.

- Authority-boundary audit workflow for `2026-06-17`: adds
  `scripts/audit_authority_boundary_candidates.py` as a discovery-only
  migration queue for authority-boundary, candidate-only, empty-promotion,
  blocked-claim, bridge-required, and adapter-canonicality duplication. The
  script emits ignored JSON/Markdown reports under
  `artifacts/authority_boundary_audit/` and is wired into
  `scripts/check_reusable_core_regression.py` with `--no-write`; it ranks
  candidates but performs no Agda rewrites or promotions.

- Six-lane formal-lens qualification tranche for `2026-06-16`: adds
  `DASHI.Core.FormalLensQualificationCore` as the reusable symbolic-rational
  lens qualification surface for Operator, Functional, Hamiltonian,
  GradientFlow, ResistiveTransport, Spectral, Group, Category, Number,
  Lattice, Topological, Probabilistic, Graph, Information, and
  SymbolicRational readings. Migrates Qi operator theory, Meditation Qi,
  typed-term role/functor, stratified comparison, background distribution,
  and cross-domain claim promotion-boundary consumers additively onto the
  lens/core adapter pattern. Formal lens qualification remains candidate-only:
  analytic, empirical, clinical, physical, theorem, metaphysical, external,
  governance, Clay, and promotion authority remain false/open.

- Six-lane reusable-core migration tranche for `2026-06-16`: adds
  `DASHI.Core.AdapterCanonicalityCore` and migrates the next biology,
  Wikidata-role, and ontology bridge consumers onto the reusable
  candidate-only, authority non-promotion, bridge requirement, empty-promotion,
  and adapter-canonicality cores. Public receipt names, constructors, booleans,
  and local false proof surfaces remain additive/stable. This is proof-plumbing
  compression only: biological truth, clinical/scientific authority, Wikidata
  edit/truth authority, ontology promotion, theorem authority, Clay, and
  terminal promotion remain false/open.

- Worker 6 docs-only canonical update for `2026-06-16`: records the exact
  remaining GR variable names for the ordered rational gauge, Shell A
  denominator, Christoffel derivative-bound, C0-stability, and Ricci
  extraction tiers; clarifies that the first NS-GW-1 synthetic/Taylor-Green
  degeneracy or tolerance-zero result is only a diagnostic sanity check and is
  not DNS sign confirmation; and names the next required real DNS calculation
  as a metadata-validated periodic Taylor-Green NPZ run reporting the
  cross-derivative, sign classification/tolerance, local eigenvalue gap, and
  eigenframe degeneracy fields. Documentation only; no Agda files were
  touched, no typechecker was run, and GR/NS/Clay promotions remain
  false/open.

- Six-lane continuation tranche for `2026-06-16`: strengthens the GR analytic
  kernel receipt surfaces with derived ordered-gauge primitive bundles, Shell A
  denominator/reciprocal projections, symbolic-kernel stability/extraction
  projections, and Schwarzschild radial-derivative/Shell A constant projections.
  It also hardens the NS-GW-1 diagnostic with NPZ metadata validation
  (`N`, `domain_length`, `grid_spacing`, finite `amplitude`, `time`,
  `snapshot_index`, source), explicit sign classification/tolerance output, and
  fail-closed Agda receipt projections for DNS sign classification still open.
  These are auditability and evidence-routing improvements only: DNS sign
  confirmation, the nonlinear Riesz sign condition, residual depletion,
  ordered-rational Christoffel C0 stability, continuum Ricci convergence, full
  Clay NS, and Clay/terminal promotions remain false/open.

- Six-lane NS-GW-1 diagnostic tranche for `2026-06-16`: adds the executable
  `scripts/ns_gateway1_strain_cross_derivative_diagnostic.py` and deterministic
  `scripts/ns_gateway1_fixture_npz.py` to measure
  `d_e1 d_e2 lambda2` at the enstrophy maximum for periodic Taylor-Green or
  NPZ velocity fields. Adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSGateway1StrainCrossDerivativeDiagnosticReceipt`,
  threads it through the full-Clay gateway and blocker-chain aggregation
  receipts, and wires it into `DASHI.Everything`. This is numerical evidence
  routing only: DNS confirmation, the nonlinear Riesz sign condition,
  residual depletion, full Clay NS, and Clay promotion remain false/open.

- Worker 6 NS blocker-chain docs intake for `2026-06-15`: canonical docs now
  record Chain A residual depletion exact shapes, Chain B
  microlocal/topological exact shapes, Chain C general-data reduction exact
  shapes, and the single full-Clay gateway theorem as theorem inputs only.
  Intended receipt names are
  `NSFullClayBlockerChainAggregationReceipt.agda` and
  `NSFullClayGatewayTheoremBoundaryReceipt.agda`. Scoped Hou-Luo/Sprint 158
  remains publishable/ready where already recorded, but full Clay NS remains
  false/open until a nonlinear Riesz sign condition or `H^{1/2}` backwards
  uniqueness theorem is supplied; `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.
  This is documentation alignment only; no Agda files or promotions were
  changed.

- Reconciled Worker 6 docs snapshot for `2026-06-15`: canonical docs now
  record GR final Shell A as `C_Gamma = 1`, `C'_Gamma = 26/27`,
  `GammaMax = 2`, `L_Gamma = 48`, and tight `C_R = 2144/27 <= 80`, with
  conservative extraction still `640`. The five proof tiers are checked
  finite tables/receipts, machine-checked Shell A constant ledger, ordered-QQ
  analytic kernel targets, continuum PDE/GR theorem gateways, and external
  authority/governance promotion. Exact GR refs are
  `GRProofArchitectureNextAnalyticKernelTrancheReceipt`,
  `SymbolicRationalChristoffelC0StabilityKernel`,
  `MachineCheckedChristoffelC0ConstantReceipt`,
  `SchwarzschildShellAExactCalculationReceipt`, and
  `GRSchwarzschildFiniteRicciBianchiPerturbationReceipt`. YM is recorded as
  having no internal math remaining for this tranche, with live blockers at
  `YMExternalAcceptancePacketNormalization`,
  `YMCompletionBoundaryTightening`, and `Gate3ClayObligations.yangMillsExternalAcceptance`;
  `clayYangMillsPromoted` remains false. NS is recorded as scoped-paper ready
  only; full Clay still requires real PDE theorem gateways through
  `NSFinalStateReceipt`, `NSFastestClayPathReceipt`,
  `NSPaper1ClayTargetReceipt`, `NSClayDistanceRevisionReceipt`, and
  `Gate3ClayObligations.navierStokesGlobalSmoothness`;
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false. This is documentation alignment
  only; no Agda files or promotions were changed.

- Worker 6 aggregation tranche for `2026-06-15`: adds
  `GRProofArchitectureNextAnalyticKernelTrancheReceipt` and threads it through
  `GRProofArchitectureAggregationTest`. The receipt cites the existing
  Continuum ordered Shell A constants, Schwarzschild Shell A exact-calculation
  ledger, and Ricci perturbation receipt, while listing the six analytic proof
  classes still required for the real Christoffel C0 stability kernel. Ordered
  QQ theorem promotion, analytic-estimate promotion, continuum Ricci
  convergence, and external Schwarzschild authority remain false.

- Six-lane PNF spectral-field invariant tranche for `2026-06-15`: adds
  `PNFSpectralRegistryAnchoring`, `PNFResidualFieldInvariants`,
  `PNFSpectralCoordinateRebuildability`, `PNFResolverSelectorCommitment`,
  `PNFHodgeResidualTopology`, and `PNFSpectralEmpiricalBasinValidation`.
  These surfaces type the formal PNF field invariants behind the architecture
  stack: span/version/registry anchoring, fibre comparability, residual
  severity-max joins and contradiction monotonicity, coordinate rebuildability,
  textual fallback non-authority, resolver/selector/admitted-package
  commitment, signed-Laplacian-first Hodge topology, and empirical basin/MDL
  validation gates. They are wired through `DASHI.Everything` and
  `Promotion.ObligationIndex`, whose PNF application boundary now has eight
  rows. Runtime parser authority, ANN authority, semantic truth,
  support/admissibility promotion, Hodge authority, empirical adequacy,
  financial advice, market prediction, production trading authority, manual
  semantic labels, threshold fishing, trading truth, Clay, and terminal
  promotion remain false.

- Six-lane PNF spectral-field architecture tranche for `2026-06-15`: adds
  `PNFSpectralFieldCore`, `PNFSpectralFieldGraph`, `PNFBraidTransportField`,
  `PNFSpectralVectorIndex`, and `PNFSpectralFieldArchitectureReceipt` as the
  checked object/fibre, residual graph/Laplacian, braid transport, and
  vector-index/resolver/selector stack. Adds
  `PNFSpectralTradingSignalBoundary` for Nashi/Mirror-style news/trading
  consumer vocabulary, and threads the architecture/trading boundary through
  `DASHI.Everything` plus `Promotion.ObligationIndex`. The vector layer remains
  proposal-only: no runtime parser, ANN backend, spectral utility proof,
  semantic truth, support/admissibility promotion, financial advice, market
  prediction guarantee, production trading authority, empirical adequacy,
  trading truth, Clay, or terminal promotion is claimed.

- Six-lane GR interval-kernel/zero-epsilon tranche for `2026-06-15`: adds the
  selected zero-epsilon connection/Ricci error-bound receipt in
  `ContinuumLimitTheorem`, records non-degenerate Schwarzschild Shell A `[3,4]`
  constants `C_Gamma = 1`, `C'_Gamma = 26/27`, `L_Gamma = 48`, `C_R = 80`, and
  Shell B `[5/2,7/2]` constants `C_Gamma = 48/25`, `C'_Gamma = 992/125`,
  `L_Gamma = 112`, `C_R = 220`, upgrades Ricci routing so `48` is point-shell
  only while interval shells use `80`/`220`, adds the selected-pair
  zero-epsilon equality bridge with arbitrary equality blocked, and aggregates
  the new interval and quantitative handoff surfaces. The actual ordered
  rational Christoffel C0 stability theorem, continuum Ricci convergence,
  Schwarzschild vacuum/Birkhoff, W4/Candidate256, Clay, and terminal
  promotions remain false.

- Six-lane GR selected-kernel/shell-bound tranche for `2026-06-15`: records the
  selected symbolic-rational Christoffel pair as the only local `refl`
  connection-error extraction, threads selected constants through
  `ContinuumLimitTheorem`, adds Schwarzschild shell-supremum receipts for
  `r_s = 2`, `r_min = r_max = 3`, `delta = 1`, tight `C_Gamma = 1`,
  conservative shell `C_Gamma <= 2`, requested formula-stability `11/9`, and
  conservative repo constant `48`, records Ricci contraction continuity
  `1280/27` rounded to `48` while preserving conservative `640`, and aggregates
  the selected-pair, Levi-Civita/Koszul, Ricci-readiness, and shell-bound
  surfaces. Arbitrary connection equality, continuum Ricci convergence,
  Schwarzschild vacuum/Birkhoff, W4/Candidate256, Clay, and terminal promotions
  remain false.

- Six-lane GR analytic-handoff tranche for `2026-06-15`: adds direct selected
  finite-r Levi-Civita handoff projections, finite inverse-metric C0 and
  derivative-sign handoff projections, exact Ricci-readiness target-name and
  zero-table projections, a kernel-parametric symbolic rational
  `FiniteCarrierChristoffelC0FromDerivativeLaw` constructor, and exact
  Schwarzschild `r_s = 2, r = 3` undoubled-Christoffel, radial `∂_r Γ`, and
  inverse-metric radial derivative tables. `GRProofArchitectureAggregationTest`
  now aggregates these selected Levi-Civita, inverse-metric, Ricci-readiness,
  and machine-checked constant surfaces. The remaining continuum blocker is
  the actual Christoffel C0 stability/extraction kernel; continuum Ricci
  convergence, Schwarzschild vacuum/Birkhoff, W4/Candidate256, Clay, and
  terminal promotions remain false.

- Six-lane GR QQ/Schwarzschild proof-term tranche for `2026-06-15`: upgrades
  the selected Christoffel lane from a finite-r-only odd-half obstruction to a
  checked symbolic QQ lift with total half/undoubling, adds inverse-metric C0
  and finite derivative consistency receipts, adds a selected finite-r
  Levi-Civita adapter that locally discharges the carrier-connection blocker,
  strengthens Ricci/Bianchi downstream readiness, records the exact
  `r_s = 2, r = 3` doubled-Christoffel point table, and extends the continuum
  derivative-to-Christoffel-C0 extraction surface. The finite-r obstruction is
  preserved as a boundary receipt. Full contracted Bianchi promotion,
  continuum Ricci convergence, Schwarzschild vacuum/Birkhoff, W4/Candidate256,
  Clay, and terminal promotions remain false.

- Six-lane surreal compactification proof-term tranche for `2026-06-15`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationQQCarrier`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationBalancedTernaryEmbedding`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationProofTermIndex`, strengthens
  `DASHI.Metric.AgreementSurrealGaugeBridge` with symbolic `3^-n` antitone,
  gauge-monotone, and gauge-ultrametric proof-term receipts, and strengthens
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationTailBoundBridge` with structural
  `kappa`, `kappa9`, truncation, and tail-shape receipts. The tranche records
  bounded internal QQ-like arithmetic and finite tower recursion only; external
  QQ/No/order authority, analytic interval/tail inequalities,
  compactification error, Monster/Carnot authority, and terminal/Clay
  promotions remain false.

- Six-lane GR proof-architecture tranche for `2026-06-15`: narrows the
  selected Christoffel/Levi-Civita, Ricci/Bianchi, convergence, and
  Schwarzschild surfaces without promoting non-flat GR.  The tranche adds the
  checked `GRSelectedUndoubledChristoffelLift` adapter and proves the canonical
  selected finite-r table cannot inhabit it at the odd `2Γ = r1` slot; adds
  reusable finite-r zero/product and contraction-zero helpers; ties the local
  Ricci/scalar/Einstein zero table to the finite `4R`/Ricci/scalar/`2G`
  arithmetic receipt; adds a finite-carrier derivative-scheme-to-connection
  convergence adapter with the exact missing derivative laws; adds a bounded
  rational-shell weak-field Schwarzschild linear-lapse adapter; and wires the
  checked surface through `DASHI.Physics.Closure.GRProofArchitectureAggregationTest`.
  Non-flat Levi-Civita, full contracted Bianchi promotion, continuum Ricci
  convergence, Schwarzschild vacuum/Birkhoff, W4/Candidate256, Clay, and
  terminal promotions remain false.

- Public authority-source artifact fetch for `2026-06-15`: downloads local
  source artifacts under `data/authority/si_metrology_20260615/` and
  `data/authority/theorem_locators_20260615/`, adds
  `DASHI.Promotion.DownloadedAuthorityArtifactReceipt`, and wires it through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The receipt binds SHA-256, byte count, access date, and
  wget provenance for the BIPM SI Brochure page/DOI/PDF artifacts, NIST
  constants page/search/all-ASCII table, NIST ASD lines form, Moonshine source
  notes, and Carnot source locators. It records downloaded ingestion rows for
  the exact raw `Delta nu Cs`, `c`, and `h` text from the NIST all-ASCII table.
  It keeps accepted SI authority tokens, NIST ASD spectral-token acceptance,
  Monster/Moonshine proof authority, Carnot/thermodynamic theorem authority,
  and all promotions false.

- Six-lane source-locator and ordered-bridge tranche for `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationOrderedQQBridge`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationTailBoundBridge`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIMetrologyExternalSourceLocator`, and
  `DASHI.Promotion.ExternalTheoremAuthoritySourceLocator`, extends
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationIntake` and
  `DASHI.Metric.AgreementSurrealGaugeBridge`, and wires the new modules through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records the exact symbolic ordered-QQ carrier
  surface, antitone dependency row, non-promoting gauge monotone and
  gauge-ultrametric-inheritance receipts, geometric-series-tail and
  kappa-tail-bound law shapes, BIPM/NIST/CODATA locator rows with raw SI
  constant text, and fail-closed Monster/Moonshine plus Carnot authority
  locator rows. It keeps concrete QQ/No/order promotion, analytic tail/error
  proofs, SHA256/access-date evidence, ingestion receipts, accepted authority
  tokens, external proof authority, and all terminal/Clay promotions false.

- Six-lane discrete-to-transcendental exact-intake strengthening for
  `2026-06-14`: extends
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactification`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationRationalBridge`,
  `DASHI.Metric.AgreementSurrealGaugeBridge`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.NatUltrametricCompletenessBridge`,
  `DASHI.Algebra.StageQuotientIrreversibilityBoundary`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CRTMonsterFixedPointCompactificationBoundary`, and
  adds `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactificationIntake`. The tranche records
  internal tower/Vec conversion and truncation receipts, exact non-promoting
  `3^-agreeDepth` gauge-shape rows, Nat-to-non-Nat completeness dependency
  ordering, no-section/reversal-gap seam lemmas, a checked symbolic rational
  approximant bridge, kappa-to-depth-9 receipts, checked Nat Cauchy
  stabilisation variables, a rational gauge row explaining why the naive
  `d_QQ = 3^-agreeDepth` equality fails at full agreement, and a typed split
  between arithmetic `196884`, J contraction, Monster coefficient receipt, and
  missing Moonshine/isomorphism authority. It keeps ordered QQ/No arithmetic,
  surreal isometry, compactification error, Monster theorem authority,
  Carnot/thermodynamic promotion, terminal claims, and Clay promotion false.

- Six-lane SI/metrology evidence-normalization tranche for `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIDefiningConstantAuthorityEvidenceChecklist`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIExactConstantConsumerIngestionBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.StoneHbarDimensionlessActionBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuantumClockEmpiricalRedshiftReceiptRequest`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.RydbergSpectroscopyAuthorityPayloadRequest`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIMetrologyPayloadDependencyDAG`, and extends
  `tests/test_atomic_clock_si_second_round3.py`, then wires the checked Agda
  modules through `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records exact authority
  evidence sockets for `Delta nu Cs`, `c`, and `h`; consumer-ingestion routing;
  the local dimensionless `H * t / hbar` action law; empirical redshift
  receipt requests; CODATA/NIST Rydberg spectroscopy authority requests; and
  the strict dependency DAG. It keeps BIPM/NIST/CODATA artifact evidence,
  SHA256/access dates, consumer ingestion, empirical redshift acceptance,
  spectroscopy authority, W4/Candidate256 tokens, and terminal promotion false.

- Six-lane discrete-to-transcendental compactification tranche for
  `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.SurrealCompactification`,
  `DASHI.Metric.AgreementSurrealGaugeBridge`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.NatUltrametricCompletenessBridge`,
  `DASHI.Algebra.StageQuotientIrreversibilityBoundary`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CRTMonsterFixedPointCompactificationBoundary`, then
  wires them through `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records finite trit tower
  approximants, prefix/suffix agreement metric receipts, the Nat-valued
  ultrametric completeness bridge, stage-quotient irreversibility as geometric
  compression rather than absence of GF(3) inverses, and CRT/J fixed-point
  compactification receipts around `196884`. It keeps surreal arithmetic,
  surreal isometry, compactification error, Monster theorem authority,
  Carnot/thermodynamic promotion, physical terminal claims, and Clay promotion
  false.

- Six-lane atomic-clock/SI-second round-three metrology tranche for
  `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIExactConstantParsedCarrierRequest`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicClockSecondRealTimeTopologyRequest`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuantumClockDimensionlessObservableLaw`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIMetreFromSecondAndCAdapter`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.W4AtomicClockCandidateReceiptChecklist`, and
  `tests/test_atomic_clock_si_second_round3.py`, then wires the checked Agda
  modules through `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records structural parsed
  carriers for exact SI constants, the Real-time topology request for Stone
  strong continuity, local dimensionless phase/redshift law checks, the
  metre-from-second-and-`c` adapter for Rydberg use, and a W4/Candidate256
  external receipt checklist. It keeps artifact evidence, authority-token
  construction, consumer ingestion, numeric payload promotion, physical Stone
  promotion, spectroscopy promotion, empirical redshift claims, W4 promotion,
  and terminal claims false.

- Six-lane Base369 finite algebra tranche for `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369RingShape`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369Nat`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369TriTruthField`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369HexTruthRing`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369NonaryTruthRing`,
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369FiniteRingLaws`, and
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369FiniteRingRegression`, plus
  `DASHI.Foundations.Base369NumeralOntologyBoundary`, then wires them through
  `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records `TriTruth` as the internal GF(3)
  finite field surface, records `HexTruth` and `NonaryTruth` as finite rings
  with typed zero-divisor witnesses, and adds regression sentinels for the key
  constructor-normalizing equalities. `Base369Nat` replaces the previous
  stdlib `Data.Nat.Base` dependency with a DASHI-namespaced builtin-only
  compatibility layer, avoiding repo-wide stdlib namespace shadowing. The
  numeral ontology boundary separates algebraic carriers, the 15-prime
  coordinate boundary, and UFT traversal addresses, while keeping narrative
  readings non-promoting. The reusable ring shape and table receipts avoid
  expanding the 700+ and 2400+ case surfaces by hand. It does not promote
  real/complex completeness, Hilbert completion, spectral theorem authority,
  physical calibration, OS/Wightman authority, Clay claims, or terminal
  unification.

- Six-lane atomic-clock/SI-second adapter tranche for `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicClockCandidate256DimensionAdapter`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.SIDefiningConstantsAuthorityArtifactRequest`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.PlanckHbarSIPayloadRequest`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuantumClockProperTimeRedshiftBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicClockW4ReceiptAdapterRequest`, and
  `tests/test_atomic_clock_si_second_round2.py`, then wires the checked Agda
  modules through `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche maps SI second/hertz/cycle
  dimensions into the Candidate256 W4 exponent vector, names exact BIPM SI
  artifact requests for `Delta nu Cs`, `c`, and `h`, records the derived
  `hbar = h / (2 pi)` request for Stone/Schrodinger, captures the leading
  atomic-clock redshift law `Delta f / f = Delta U / c^2`, and maps atomic
  clock bridge fields onto the W4 external receipt field surface. It keeps
  artifact loading, parsed carriers, Candidate256 authority tokens, external
  receipt construction, empirical redshift claims, Stone/W4 promotion, and
  terminal claims false.

- Six-lane atomic-clock/SI-second metrology tranche for `2026-06-14`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicClockSISecondCalibrationBridge`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.Cs133NumericAuthorityPayloadRequest`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuantumClockSIObservableBridge`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.StoneSISecondTimeParameterBridge`,
  `DASHI.Promotion.RydbergClockMetreBridge`, and
  `tests/test_atomic_clock_si_bridge.py`, then wires the checked Agda modules
  through `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records SI time/frequency unit
  shape, Cs-133 exact-value payload requirements, quantum-clock observable
  dependencies, Gate 5 time-parameter requirements, and the clock-to-metre
  route for Rydberg spectroscopy. It deliberately keeps BIPM/NIST artifact
  ingestion, local external authority construction, numeric promotion,
  Candidate256/W4 physical calibration, physical Stone promotion, chemistry
  promotion, spectroscopy promotion, and terminal claims false.

- Six-lane Agda/PhysLean physics-library parity tranche for `2026-06-14`: after
  refreshing ChatGPT thread `Physics Library for Agda`
  (`6a2e6b6c-f4b0-83ec-b233-126757c70248`,
  canonical archive thread `95d1157fa037ad3143960e629431b1d40439396c`), adds
  `DASHI.Foundations.PhysicsLinearAnalysisParity`,
  `DASHI.Geometry.DifferentialGeometryParity`,
  `DASHI.Algebra.LieGaugeTheoryParity`,
  `DASHI.Algebra.Quantum.QFTParitySurface`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.GRPDEParityBoundary`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AgdaPhysicsParityRoadmapReceipt`, then wires them
  through `DASHI.Everything`. The tranche records reusable fail-closed
  interfaces for linear analysis, differential geometry, Lie/gauge theory,
  QM/QFT, GR/PDE, and theorem ergonomics. It explicitly keeps PhysLean parity,
  external continuum theorem imports, Clay promotions, and terminal
  unification false or authority-blocked.
  A follow-up exact-intake pass in the same tranche strengthens those six
  modules with checked law-shape rows for scalar/vector/Hilbert/operator/
  spectral/ODE data, manifold/chart/exterior-calculus identities, Lie/gauge
  Jacobi/curvature/YM/Wilson/BRST/gauge-fixing data, QFT Hilbert/CCR/CAR/Fock/
  OS/Wightman data, GR/PDE Koszul/curvature/Einstein/weak-solution/energy
  estimate data, and the finite discrete-YM spectral theorem example receipt,
  while preserving every no-promotion boundary.
  A proof-term-level occupant pass then pins the exact field names, formula
  texts, indexed finite-basis combinators, SU(2)/SU(3) finite-Jacobi rows,
  BRST nilpotence actions, OS/Wightman false-authority rows, MTW/contracted
  Bianchi/SI-unit rows, and the finite discrete-YM boolean pattern as checked
  receipts. Focused Agda checks pass for all six parity modules; no continuum
  or Clay authority is fabricated.

- Six-lane Gate 3 theorem-package tranche for `2026-06-13`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3DensityOfCarrierCoreConstructedReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3MoscoRecoveryConstructedReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3NoSpectralPollutionConstructedReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3MassShellBridgeConstructedReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3UniformSeparationConstructedReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3TheoremPackageCurrentStateReceipt`, then threads
  that package into `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CurrentProofProfileReceipt`. The
  repo now records Gate 3 density, Mosco, no-spectral-pollution, mass-shell,
  and uniform-separation theorem surfaces as locally closed while keeping
  `gate3Promoted = false`, Clay promotion false, and the publication
  legitimacy boundary fail-closed.

- Six-lane YM gauge-sector/final-boundary tranche for `2026-06-13`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMBRSTGaugeFixedOS3PhysicalSectorReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMGhostTimeReflectionGradedSignReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMContinuumGribovResolutionReceipt`, sharpens
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMClayPromotionBoundary`, aligns
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ClayNSCurrentStateReceipt`, and updates
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CurrentProofProfileReceipt`. The repo now records the
  BRST physical-sector OS3 surface, ghost graded-sign surface, and continuum
  Gribov boundary surface as locally closed while keeping ungraded ghost
  positivity, unrestricted Krein positivity, Clay YM, NS Clay, terminal, and
  cross-lane promotion false. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMFinalStateReceipt` is
  narrowed so its canonical YM open-blocker list now collapses to
  `clayYangMillsOpen` only.

- Six-lane YM continuum theorem-wire tranche for `2026-06-13`: consumes the
  Lean-backed closure payloads for H3a/H3b/thermodynamic/OS/Wightman/mass-gap/
  uniqueness and rewires the canonical YM ledger accordingly. The repo now
  records actual same-prime `p=7` polymer-activity supply, H3a continuum
  intake, H3b vacuum-projector continuity, no-spectral-pollution,
  thermodynamic limit, OS/reflection-positivity, Wightman reconstruction,
  operator convergence, uniform mass gap, and continuum uniqueness as true at
  their owning theorem surfaces; `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMFinalStateReceipt`
  now records `continuumYangMillsConstructed = true`,
  `gaugeSectorOSContinuumConstructed = true`,
  `uniformMassGapConstructed = true`, and
  `continuumUniquenessConstructed = true` while keeping Clay and terminal
  promotion false. The weak-coupling threshold wording is also corrected to
  `c_K >= (4/3) log(24e)` in the live p=7 YM theorem surfaces and roadmap
  docs.

- Six-lane canonical YM/NS theorem-surface tranche for `2026-06-13`: closes
  the exact lane-local theorem surfaces consumed this round. The p=7 YM lane
  now records `localKPSumBelowOneProved = true` in
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMActualP7WilsonPolymerActivityReceipt`; the
  strict-absorption bridge now records the supplied p=7 KP inequality with
  `rho_actual = 1/2 < 1`; the uniform-volume KP lane now records
  `uniformVolumeKPProved = true`; the Balaban RG lane now records
  `balabanRGTransferProved = true`; and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSFinalStateReceipt` now records
  `enstrophyPassageClosed = true`,
  `vorticityControlClosed = true`,
  `lInfinityVorticityControlClosed = true`, and
  `globalRegularityClosed = true` while keeping Clay and terminal promotion
  false. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMFinalStateReceipt` and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Paper3YMDependencyGraphReceipt` are updated to
  reflect those lane-local closures, while continuum YM, H3a/H3b intake,
  mass gap, Clay YM, and terminal/full-unification promotions remain open.

- Six-lane weak-coupling polymer convergence tranche for `2026-06-13`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMLatticeAnimalCountingBoundReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMWeakCouplingRatioBoundReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMGeometricTailHalfBoundReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMPolymerWeakCouplingSumBoundReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMP7WeakCouplingPolymerConvergenceReceipt`, and
  `scripts/ym_weak_coupling_polymer_sum_bound.py`. The tranche records the
  `d=4` lattice-animal count surface `N_n <= (8e)^n`, the tuned
  weak-coupling ratio surface `a = c_K / (4 g^2)`, the later-corrected
  p=7 threshold `c_K >= (4/3) log(24e)`, the geometric-tail `<= 1/2`
  surface, the grouped origin-containing weighted polymer sum target, and the
  bridge back into the same-prime `p=7` Wilson activity lane. The tranche
  began as fail-closed support-only bookkeeping; the current tranche above is
  what later promotes the exact lane-local p=7 KP theorem surface while
  leaving continuum YM and Clay closed.

- Six-lane Balaban YM boundary tranche for `2026-06-12`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMActualPolymerActivityCandidateReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMPolymerActivityStrictAbsorptionBridgeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMKPUniformVolumeInductionBoundaryReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMBalabanRGInductionCandidateReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMH3bVacuumProjectorNoSpectralPollutionBoundaryReceipt`,
  and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMThermodynamicOSWightmanOperatorBoundaryReceipt`.
  The tranche threads the new fail-closed Balaban/YM surfaces into
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Paper3YMDependencyGraphReceipt` and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMFinalStateReceipt`. It sharpens YM5 actual polymer
  activity, the actual-polymer-to-strict-absorption bridge, the KP
  uniform-volume induction boundary, the YM6 Balaban RG induction lane, the
  H3b/no-spectral-pollution downstream interface, and the thermodynamic
  limit -> OS/Wightman/operator-convergence/uniqueness bundle without
  promoting continuum YM, mass gap, Clay YM, or terminal status.

- Candidate-receipt and honest-probe refactor for `2026-06-12`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSCandidateCompleteEnstrophyBKMPassageReceipt` and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YML3TightnessBoundedCandidateReceipt`, threads those
  bounded candidate surfaces into
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSFinalStateReceipt` and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMFinalStateReceipt`, extends
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Paper0SharedMarginDependencyReceipt` with a
  candidate-only lane-specific analytics witness, and surfaces
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PromotionProbeCutsetReceipt` through
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsClosure`. The round also rewrites
  `DASHI.Physics.Probes.AllProbes` and the four probe lane modules so the
  aggregate compiles against fail-closed cutset contracts instead of impossible
  promotion witnesses. Clay/terminal/full-unification promotions remain
  false/open.

- Finite projection/nonlocality spectral tranche for `2026-06-08`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDefectLaplacianRankOneSpectrum`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSMonodromyIntegralBoundFinite`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMBTMetricRatioDefectGapFinite`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.YMStrictSelectedHodgeVariationToyPairing`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSThreeCaseDefectResidualExhaustionFinite`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UniformProjectionNonlocalityGapFinite`, plus focused
  tests and `DASHI.Everything` imports. The tranche turns the current
  projection/nonlocality sketch into checked finite arithmetic: NS
  `lambda_delta = cos^2(alpha) sin^2(alpha)` samples `0,3,4,3,0` over `16`,
  a four-point monodromy average `1/2`, finite YM/BT
  `kappa_p = (p - 1)^2 / p^2` for `p = 2,3,5`, a non-vacuous toy selected
  Hodge variation pairing, a finite NS three-case residual table, and a finite
  uniform projection/nonlocality receipt. The continuum semiclassical measure,
  topological stretching leakage, pressure commutator gain, real selected
  Hodge variation, BT finite Hodge theorem, YM continuum mass gap, Clay/YM/NS
  promotions, semantic unification, and terminal promotion remain false/open.

- Sprint166 projection/nonlocality leakage frontier for `2026-06-08`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ProjectionNonlocalityLeakagePrincipleBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Sprint166ProjectionNonlocalityLeakagePrincipleReceipt`,
  three deterministic emitters, output bundles, focused tests, and
  `DASHI.Promotion.ObligationIndex` integration as the seventh full-Clay
  external-authority boundary row. The round records the shared commutator
  frontier: NS pressure leakage would require a non-scalar matrix/eigenbundle
  `[Pi_+, R_i R_j]` commutator, while YM/BT Hodge variation exposes
  `[d_A,*]F_A` as the finite Hodge-gauge compatibility defect. It explicitly
  rejects scalar Fourier cutoff/Riesz noncommutation as the NS pressure-gain
  source and keeps `ProjectionNonlocalityTheorem`,
  `PressureNonlocalityClosure`, `NSCriticalResidualNonPositive`,
  `FullLocalDefectMonotonicity`, finite Hodge variation closure, Clay/YM/NS
  promotions, and terminal promotion false.

- Sprint165 P0 Clay finite-Hodge / NS stack for `2026-06-08`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.P0ClayFiniteHodgeNSTopologicalStackReceipt`, three
  deterministic emitters, generated output bundles, focused tests, and
  `DASHI.Promotion.ObligationIndex` integration for both the finite-depth
  boundary observable pipeline and the new P0 stack. The round makes the
  current proof order explicit: `BTFiniteHodgeVariationTheorem` is the next
  overall analytic calculation, while `AngularDegeneracyPressureCommutatorGain`
  is the next NS-only Clay calculation. Maxwell, YM/Yang-Mills,
  NS/Navier-Stokes, empirical observable, continuum, Clay, and terminal
  promotions remain false.

- Semantic/fiber bridge finite theorem round for `2026-06-08`: adds
  `DASHI.Interop.FiberedCrankDASHISystem`,
  `DASHI.Interop.ABIVerticalLiftBoundary`,
  `DASHI.Interop.FiniteSelectionMiningTermination`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ScaleLocalObservableCriterion`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.BruhatTitsHolographicCoordinateBoundary`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSheafTopologicalObstructionBridge`, plus focused
  tests and `DASHI.Everything` imports. The round closes concrete finite
  surfaces for artifact/semantic fibration, ABI vertical-lift accounting,
  finite Nat-valued selection descent, scale-local observables, BT coordinate
  projection, and the Sprint-163-anchored NS sheaf obstruction bridge. It keeps
  JMD crank/protagonist/crank-mining terminology as imported bridge vocabulary
  only and keeps semantic entropy grounding, physical ontology, continuum
  observables, holographic QFT promotion, topological stretching leakage,
  sheaf gluing, pressure commutator gain, mechanism exhaustion, Clay promotion,
  and terminal unification false/open.

- Sprint 164 NS microlocal/topological bridge boundary for `2026-06-08`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint164MicrolocalTopologicalBridgeBoundaryReceipt`,
  three Sprint 164 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 163 and records microlocal alignment concentration,
  topological stretching leakage, angular-degeneracy pressure commutator gain,
  and degeneracy-riding cascade as theorem targets only. It records
  `MicrolocalAlignmentConcentrationTargetRecorded=true`,
  `TopologicalStretchingLeakageTargetRecorded=true`,
  `AngularDegeneracyPressureCommutatorGainTargetRecorded=true`, and
  `DegeneracyRidingCascadeTargetRecorded=true`, while keeping
  `MicrolocalAlignmentConcentrationLemma`,
  `TopologicalStretchingLeakageLemma`,
  `AngularDegeneracyPressureCommutatorGain`, `FullLocalDefectMonotonicity`,
  `MechanismExhaustionForFullClayNS`, `full_clay_ns_solved`,
  `fullClayNSSolved`, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` false.

- Semantic compression invariance target for `2026-06-08`: adds
  `DASHI.Interop.SemanticCompressionInvarianceTarget`, imports it through
  `DASHI.Everything`, and adds a focused regression test. The receipt names
  the central cross-project chain
  `Artifact/CID -> FRACTRAN trace -> FactorVec prime geometry ->
  MDL/post-entropy -> Observable/Prediction`, records a typed commuting-square
  target, and anchors to `CompressionAdmissibilityReceipt`. It keeps
  `semanticConservationTheoremProved`,
  `exactPostEntropyInvarianceProved`,
  `epsilonPostEntropyInvarianceProved`, `physicalProjectionPromoted`, and
  `terminalUnificationPromoted` false.

- Sprint 163 NS topological-alignment obstruction boundary for `2026-06-08`:
  adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint163TopologicalAlignmentObstructionBoundaryReceipt`,
  three Sprint 163 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 162 and records Sanni 2025/protocols.io as source-bound
  symbol-level support only: angular strain symbol degeneracy and maximal
  eigenbundle non-orientability are vocabulary for the Sigma target, not a PDE
  theorem. It records `TopologicalAlignmentObstructionSourceRecorded=true`,
  `CriticalAlignmentTopologicalExhaustionTargetRecorded=true`, and
  `PressureFluxSubcriticalGainOpen=true`, while keeping
  `CriticalAlignmentTopologicalExhaustion`,
  `BlowupImpliesSigmaConcentration`, `SigmaConcentrationImpossible`,
  `PressureStretchingDepletionLemma`, `MechanismExhaustionForFullClayNS`,
  `full_clay_ns_solved`, `fullClayNSSolved`, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` false.

- Sprint 162 NS critical-residual boundary for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint162CriticalResidualBoundaryReceipt`,
  three Sprint 162 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 161 and narrows the Clay-closing estimate to the
  pressure-flux / stretching-alignment / dissipation residual fork. It records
  `CriticalResidualBoundaryRecorded=true`,
  `LocalDefectIterationRouteScoped=true`, `PressureFluxResidualTyped=true`,
  and `StretchingAlignmentResidualTyped=true`, while keeping
  `NoPersistentPositiveNSCriticalResidual`,
  `PressureStretchingDepletionLemma`, `MechanismExhaustionForFullClayNS`,
  `full_clay_ns_solved`, `fullClayNSSolved`, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` false.

- Sprint 161 NS mechanism-exhaustion analytic-attempt boundary for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint161MechanismExhaustionAnalyticAttemptBoundaryReceipt`,
  three Sprint 161 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 160 and records the ancient-solution /
  local-defect-monotonicity route, local defect-energy gap, and critical-profile
  taxonomy as fail-closed analytic attempt artifacts. It keeps
  `MechanismExhaustionForFullClayNS`, general-data critical-profile extraction,
  non-axisymmetric vortex-stretching depletion, pressure nonlocality closure,
  finite critical-profile taxonomy, full general-data BKM continuation,
  `full_clay_ns_solved`, `fullClayNSSolved`,
  `fullNavierStokesSolutionConstructed`, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` false.

- Sprint 160 NS no-local-Clay-mechanism sprint rule for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint160NoLocalClayMechanismSprintRuleReceipt`,
  three Sprint 160 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 159, records
  `NoLocalClayMechanismSprintWithoutNewPDEMath=true`,
  `SymmetricHouLuoPublicationIsolation=true`,
  `NewPDEMathematicsRequired=true`, and
  `ExternalAuthorityArtifactRequired=true`, while setting
  `MoreLocalizedEnstrophySprintsAuthorized=false`. The tier map makes the next
  local priority SM/Higgs observable promotion, then Hodge/Maxwell finite
  geometry, with Clay NS and continuum YM mass gap retained as
  external-boundary targets. Full Clay NS, mechanism exhaustion, full general
  Navier-Stokes construction, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 159 NS full-Clay external-authority boundary round for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint159FullClayExternalAuthorityBoundaryReceipt`,
  three Sprint 159 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 158, records symmetric Hou-Luo regularity as scoped
  support only, adds a one-row full-Clay external-authority boundary layer to
  `DASHI.Promotion.ObligationIndex`, and records
  `ExternalAuthorityBoundary=true`. `MechanismExhaustionForFullClayNS`,
  general-data critical-profile reduction, non-axisymmetric vortex-stretching
  control, pressure nonlocality closure, full NS continuation, Clay submission
  promotion, full Clay Navier-Stokes, full general Navier-Stokes construction,
  and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 158 NS symmetric Hou-Luo theorem-class closure round for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint158SymmetricHouLuoRegularityClassClosureReceipt`,
  three Sprint 158 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  anchors to Sprint 157 BKM/continuation closure, records the publication
  theorem assumptions, and promotes
  `SymmetricHouLuoRegularityClassClosure=true` and
  `SymmetricAxisymmetricWithSwirlGlobalRegularity=true` for smooth
  finite-energy `H^s`, `s >= 3`, axisymmetric-with-swirl, `z -> -z`
  symmetric data with bounded Gamma/circulation input. The full Clay
  mechanism-exhaustion gate, general smooth finite-energy Navier-Stokes,
  full Clay Navier-Stokes, full general Navier-Stokes construction, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 157 NS BKM-integral continuation round for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint157BKMIntegralContinuationReceipt`, three
  Sprint 157 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round anchors
  to Sprint 156 model validity, records the corrected Omega ODE integration
  into finite BKM-integral bounds on finite horizons, records the classical
  BKM continuation bootstrap, and promotes `BKMIntegralEstimate=true`,
  `ContinuationTheoremBridge=true`, and `SymmetricHouLuoBKMFinite=true` for
  the symmetric Hou-Luo route only. `SymmetricHouLuoRegularityClassClosure`
  remains open as theorem-level publication wording; `MechanismExhaustionForFullClayNS`,
  full Clay Navier-Stokes, full general Navier-Stokes construction, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 156 NS model-validity-for-width-ODE round for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint156ModelValidityForWidthODEReceipt`, three
  Sprint 156 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round carries
  the closed Sprint 155 scale-delta support package into
  `ModelValidityForWidthODE=true` for the symmetric Hou-Luo width-model
  reduction, records the corrected equilibrium
  `delta_new = sqrt(nu/(Umax*logOmega))`, and emits a BKM bridge-readiness
  ledger where `ModelValidityForWidthODE=true` and `CorrectedOmegaODE=true`.
  `SymmetricHouLuoBKMFinite`, full Clay Navier-Stokes, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 155 NS localized-enstrophy IBP gate round for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint155LocalizedEnstrophyIBPReceipt`, three
  Sprint 155 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round records
  Sprint 154 Biot-Savart/nonlocal and simultaneous-constants closures as route
  support, records the fixed-scale localized omega1 enstrophy IBP identity as
  closed, and emits an assembler where `LocalizedEnstrophyIdentity`,
  `BiotSavartNonlocalClosure`, `SimultaneousConstants`, `AnnularLeakage`, and
  `SourceBound` are closed support rows. `ModelValidityForWidthODE`,
  `SymmetricHouLuoBKMFinite`, full Clay Navier-Stokes, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 153 NS localized vortex-stretching source gate round for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint153LocalizedVortexStretchingSourceReceipt`,
  three Sprint 153 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round
  records Sprint 152 annular leakage domination as support/conditional only.
  The localized source ledger normalizes the evidence shape
  `2*u1*v*Omega*delta^2`; the constant scan emits 540 rows with 216 support,
  216 open, and 108 blocker rows; and the source/dissipation/leakage balance
  emits 10 rows with 3 absorbed, 4 residual, and 3 open rows.
  `LocalizedVortexStretchingSourceBound`,
  `BiotSavartNonlocalClosureAtScaleDelta`,
  `SimultaneousConstantsCompatibility`, `ModelValidityForWidthODE`,
  `SymmetricHouLuoBKMFinite`, full Clay Navier-Stokes, and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 151 NS localized-enstrophy identity gate round for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint151LocalizedEnstrophyIdentityReceipt`, three
  Sprint 151 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests. The round records
  Sprint 150 width-equilibrium, subcritical ODE, and Gronwall closure support
  as conditional only. The localized identity ledger keeps cutoff transport,
  diffusion-boundary, vortex-stretching/source, Biot-Savart/nonlocal,
  annular/boundary, constants compatibility, and width-ODE extraction open.
  The cutoff budget records absorbed transport/diffusion sample rows but keeps
  source localization, annular leakage, and joint annular/source absorption
  unresolved. The width-ODE extractor supports only reduced-model equilibrium
  evidence; it does not derive the model from full Navier-Stokes.
  `LocalizedEnstrophyIdentityAtScaleDelta`, `ModelValidityForWidthODE`,
  `ScalingCouplingConsistency`, `SymmetricHouLuoBKMFinite`, full Clay
  Navier-Stokes, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 149 NS scaling-consistency gate round for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint149ScalingConsistencyGateReceipt`, three
  Sprint 149 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  records Sprint 148 explicit-data/crossing/source support as support only,
  with corrected growth and migration-threshold closure conditional on
  beta-positive scaling.  The scaling gate ledger keeps
  `ScalingConsistencyForHouLuoConcentration` false/open; the linearization
  probe records toy beta-positive candidates without proving a self-similar
  profile; the energy-width ledger records candidate width inequalities while
  keeping `energyWidthLowerBoundProved=false` and
  `alphaLessThanOneProved=false`.  `SymmetricHouLuoBKMFinite`, full Clay
  Navier-Stokes, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 147 NS migration-initiation threshold round for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSMigrationInitiationThresholdReceipt`, three Sprint
  147 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round records exact
  `PureDiffusionAtSymmetryPlane=true`, failed
  `MaximumLocationMigrationExclusionForVBarrier=false`, identified
  migration-driven blowup structure, and
  `MigrationInitiationThresholdForLargeData` as the highest-alpha next gate.
  The threshold ledger normalizes source-integral, symmetry-plane diffusion,
  off-axis gain, viscosity suppression, log-feedback, finite-energy
  admissibility, and Clay guard rows.  The reduced ODE scan records some toy
  regimes where migration initiates before suppression, but theorem, blowup
  existence, full Clay Navier-Stokes, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain
  false.

- Sprint 145 NS comparison-envelope obstruction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint145ComparisonEnvelopeObstructionReceipt`,
  three Sprint 145 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  attacks `ComparisonEnvelopeForNonlocalPsi1AndRadialCommutators` and keeps it
  fail-closed: the desired joint inequality for
  `2*u1*partial_z^2 psi1 - (partial_z u^r)*partial_r u1` is normalized, but
  sign-changing nonlocal `psi1`, off-peak forcing, radial/log Biot-Savart
  commutator hazards, boundary/annular constants, adverse reinforcement
  source/commutator alignment rows, and absent signed residual slack prevent a
  simultaneous comparison envelope.  The coupled zero-number theorem,
  secondary-peak exclusion, global axial monotonicity, full Clay
  Navier-Stokes, and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remain false.

- Sprint 144 NS coupled zero-number obstruction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint144CoupledZeroNumberObstructionReceipt`,
  three Sprint 144 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  attacks `CoupledAxisymmetricZeroNumberForVBarrier` and keeps it fail-closed:
  scalar one-dimensional zero-number/Sturm support is recorded only as a
  template, while coupled r-z topology, nonlocal `psi1` source, radial/log
  commutator hazards, moving boundary/annular intervals, absent comparison
  envelope, and missing compatible constants prevent transfer to the actual
  `v = partial_z u1` barrier.  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 143 NS secondary-peak exclusion obstruction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint143SecondaryPeakExclusionObstructionReceipt`,
  three Sprint 143 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  attacks the Sprint 140 `SecondaryPeakExclusion` input and keeps it
  fail-closed: local single-peak, symmetry, and parabolic support are
  accepted, but nonlinear shoulder formation, off-center positive
  `v = partial_z u1` crossings, missing coupled axisymmetric zero-number/Sturm
  control, boundary/annular migration, and absent compatible constants/theorem
  keep the global barrier open.  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 142 NS global-concavity obstruction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint142GlobalConcavityObstructionReceipt`, three
  Sprint 142 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  attacks the Sprint 140 `GlobalConcavityOfPsi1` input and keeps it
  fail-closed: local Taylor concavity support is accepted, but the normalized
  crossing-set inequality remains missing; the kernel stress sampler records
  favorable local same-z rows alongside adverse axial-offset, annular,
  boundary-image, and far-tail rows; the boundary/annulus ledger records the
  missing boundary-compatible kernel/sign/cancellation theorem.  Full Clay
  Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 141 NS commutator-domination obstruction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint141CommutatorDominationObstructionReceipt`,
  three Sprint 141 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  attacks the Sprint 140 `TransportCommutatorDominationForVBarrier` input and
  keeps it fail-closed: the normalized inequality ledger records the positive
  nonhomogeneous commutator term, missing simultaneous constants, and absent
  log-aware theorem; the Biot-Savart sampler records local bounded rows but
  also near-coincident ring/off-axis annulus log-loss hazards; the radial
  coupling ledger records that axial first-crossing geometry and Gamma control
  do not determine `partial_r u1`.  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved
  and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 140 NS conditional barrier assembly for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint140ConditionalBarrierAssemblyReceipt`, three
  Sprint 140 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The tranche
  assembles the conditional interface selected by Sprint 139: if
  `GlobalConcavityOfPsi1`, `SecondaryPeakExclusion`, and
  `TransportCommutatorDominationForVBarrier` are externally supplied with
  compatible constants, then the local `v = partial_z u1` barrier feeds
  conditional monitored-route regularity and conditional BKM finiteness for
  the symmetric Hou-Luo route.  The constants ledger records all required
  margins/windows/log budgets as absent, and the failure matrix keeps the
  route open under false assumptions, incompatible constants, off-center
  crossings, boundary/annular kernel sign defects, commutator log loss, and
  absent full Clay translation.  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 139 NS axial-barrier route fork for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint139AxialBarrierRouteForkReceipt`, three
  Sprint 139 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The tranche
  records a fail-closed fork after Sprint 138: local `v = partial_z u1`
  barrier support remains true, while `GlobalConcavityOfPsi1`,
  `SecondaryPeakExclusion`, and
  `TransportCommutatorDominationForVBarrier` remain open.  The route
  classifier ranks conditional assembly first and transport commutator
  domination second; the kernel sampler records favorable local rows but
  nonlocal annular/boundary/tail sign-indefinite obstruction rows; the
  commutator route records the required pointwise sign or log-aware dominance
  theorem as unavailable.  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 138 NS axial monotonicity blocker reduction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint138AxialMonotonicityBlockerReductionReceipt`,
  three Sprint 138 emitters, generated outputs, and focused tests.  The round
  records local support for the `v = partial_z u1` barrier while keeping
  `GlobalConcavityOfPsi1`, `SecondaryPeakExclusion`, and
  `TransportCommutatorDominationForVBarrier` open.  Global concavity is blocked
  by nonlocal elliptic/kernel/boundary persistence issues; secondary peak
  exclusion is blocked by nonlinear shoulder and missing coupled zero-number
  control; commutator domination is blocked by the nonhomogeneous
  `-(partial_z u^r) partial_r u1` term and the restored log Biot-Savart strain
  hazard.  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 137 NS axial monotonicity gate for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint137_axial_monotonicity_gate.py`, generated outputs, and
  focused tests.  The emitter records the `v = partial_z u1` barrier ledger:
  symmetry inheritance, initial sign, first-positive-crossing geometry,
  differentiated source term, local concavity support, and diffusion sign are
  explicit.  The local barrier is supported, but the global theorem remains
  fail-closed on `global_concavity_blocker` and `secondary_peak_blocker`.
  Full Clay Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and
  `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 136 NS symmetric Hou-Luo source-sign result for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSprint136HouLuoSymmetricSourceSignReceipt`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint136_hou_luo_symmetric_source_sign.py`, generated outputs,
  and focused tests.  The tranche records `LogLossSourceLowerBound=false` in
  the canonical z-reflection symmetric Hou-Luo scenario: source is zero on
  `z=0`, nonpositive under the required/open
  `AxialMonotonicityOfSwirlProfile` gate away from the symmetry plane, and
  viscosity is nonpositive at an interior maximum.  The BKM-finite statement is
  conditional on axial monotonicity only; there is no global NS theorem and no
  Clay promotion.

- Sprint 135 NS corrected Hou-Luo phase map and gate classifier for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint135_hou_luo_source_viscosity_phase.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint135_hou_luo_blowup_gate_classifier.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint135_corrected_status_assembly.py`, with matching generated
  output receipts and tests.  The tranche records that polynomial
  source/viscosity bookkeeping is insufficient as an obstruction, while the
  corrected log-Gronwall source scale can beat polynomial viscous damping.
  It still does not prove blowup or regularity: the actual PDE source requires
  sign, alignment, localization, lower/upper bounds, and smooth-data bootstrap
  control.  The classifier records 21 open gates, with
  `LogLossSourceLowerBound` as the highest-alpha blowup-side gate and
  `LogLossSourceUpperControl` as the fallback regularity-side gate.  Full Clay
  Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 134 NS axisymmetric correction and Hou-Luo retraction for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint134_axisymmetric_equation_correction.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint134_biot_savart_log_singularity_audit.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint134_hou_luo_retraction_status.py`, with matching generated
  output receipts and tests.  The tranche corrects the Hou-Luo equations:
  `u1` is not pure diffusion, while `Gamma = r u^theta = r^2 u1` is the
  maximum-principle quantity on which annular `u1` bounds must rest.  It also
  falsifies `NoLogAxisymmetricBiotSavartUniform` uniformly away from the axis
  using the elliptic-integral logarithmic asymptotic
  `K(k) ~ log(4/sqrt(1-k^2))`.  Consequently
  `AxisymmetricHouLuoNSViscousDominanceObstruction` is retracted, and the
  Hou-Luo axisymmetric-with-swirl Navier-Stokes route is recorded as
  `open_live_candidate`, neither obstructed nor confirmed.  Full Clay
  Navier-Stokes remains unsolved and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 133 NS universal-strategy and axisymmetric-with-swirl pivot for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint133_universal_strategy_classifier.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint133_no_log_biot_savart_scope.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint133_axisymmetric_swirl_target.py`, with matching generated
  output receipts and tests.  The tranche records that the full Clay
  obstruction-tower exhaustion gap is not closed by mechanism enumeration, that
  `NoLogAxisymmetricBiotSavartUniform` alone closes only the
  `AXS beta>0 moderate-Re` subcase with
  `clay_progress_estimate_percent = 0`, and that the concrete Clay-adjacent
  target is `AxisymmetricNSWithSwirlGlobalRegularity`.  Its four finite gates
  are `large_re_axisymmetric_transient_control`,
  `marginal_beta_zero_analysis`,
  `axisymmetric_symmetry_class_exhaustion`, and
  `axisymmetric_swirl_global_assembly`; full Clay Navier-Stokes remains
  unsolved and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 132 NS partial obstruction theorem and complete gap map for
  `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint132_partial_obstruction_theorem.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint132_mechanism_exhaustion_audit.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint132_gap_inventory_classifier.py`, with matching generated
  output receipts.  The tranche records
  `NSPartialRegularityFromObstructionTower` for analyzed
  `CLASS_WBF union CLASS_AXS` routes only, enumerates four failed
  mechanism-exhaustion bridges from the obstruction tower to Clay, and
  classifies the programme state as four exact closed WBF gaps, two
  conditionally closed gaps, and five open regimes.  The next analytic proof is
  `NoLogAxisymmetricBiotSavartUniform`; full Clay Navier-Stokes remains
  unsolved and `clayNavierStokesPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 131 NS Hou-Luo obstruction assembly for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint131_source_upper_bound_audit.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint131_localized_viscous_comparison_audit.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint131_hou_luo_obstruction_assembly.py`, with matching
  generated output receipts.  The tranche records `RigorousSourceUpperBound`,
  `LocalizedViscousLowerComparison`, candidate scaling, axis/boundary
  conditions, and the assembled
  `AxisymmetricHouLuoNSViscousDominanceObstruction` for the Hou-Luo viscous
  Navier-Stokes route only.  It does not solve full Clay Navier-Stokes and
  keeps `clayNavierStokesPromoted` false.

- Sprint 130 NS viscous dominance obstruction for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint130_u1_maximum_principle_audit.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint130_viscous_dominance_sampler.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint130_route_fork_classifier.py`, with matching generated
  output receipts.  The tranche records the pure-diffusion maximum principle
  `||u1(t)||_inf <= M0` and the viscous/source ratio
  `nu * tau^(-3 beta)`, which diverges throughout the strict
  `1 < alpha < 3/2`, `beta = alpha - 1` window.  The Hou-Luo route is
  therefore obstructed for viscous Navier-Stokes; Euler remains separate/open
  on `NoLogAxisymmetricBiotSavartUniform` and
  `SourceAlignmentWithVorticityMaximum`; Clay Navier-Stokes promotion remains
  false.

- Sprint 129 NS advective concentration audit for `2026-06-07`: adds
  `scripts/ns_sprint129_advective_concentration_audit.py`,
  `scripts/ns_sprint129_feasibility_window_sampler.py`, and
  `scripts/ns_sprint129_source_balance_classifier.py`, with matching generated
  output receipts.  The tranche records the exact axisymmetric-with-swirl
  amplification system, the no-log Biot-Savart status, and the strict
  `1 < alpha < 3/2`, `beta = alpha - 1` feasibility window.  The remaining
  gate is `AdvectiveConcentrationVsDiffusionBound`; Clay Navier-Stokes
  promotion remains false.

- Sprint 120 certificate audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  external common-carrier construction certificates, weak compactness
  certificates, common-carrier feed-through closure reduction, Mosco aggregate
  closure certificates, and transfer-calculus closure certificates.  The
  generator `scripts/ym_sprint120_certificate_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint120_certificate_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  Sprint 120 converts the Sprint119 unlock blockers into exact
  certificate rows with source paths, upstream false flags, and
  absent-certificate reasons.  External analytic certificates, transfer
  lower-bound theorem, continuum mass gap, and Clay/YM promotion remain false.

- Sprint 119 unlock audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  common-carrier feed-through unlock, weak compactness obligation reduction,
  Mosco all-obligations reduction, transfer-calculus all-obligations
  reduction, and transfer-readiness unlock reduction.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint119_unlock_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint119_unlock_audit/` with route decision `fail-closed`.
  Sprint 119 normalizes the Sprint118 readiness blockers into exact unlock
  inputs and keeps common-carrier feed-through, weak compactness, aggregate
  Mosco/calculus obligation closure, transfer readiness, transfer theorem,
  continuum mass gap, and Clay/YM promotion false.

- Sprint 118 readiness audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  criterion-feed aggregation, common-carrier construction readiness, Mosco
  compactness readiness, transfer-calculus readiness, and the transfer blocker
  matrix.  The generator `scripts/ym_sprint118_readiness_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint118_readiness_audit/` with route decision `fail-closed`.
  Sprint 118 aggregates Sprint117 norm/residual/sector feed closures into one
  positive feed package and narrows the fail-closed transfer route to
  common-carrier construction/feed-through, weak compactness, aggregate
  Mosco/calculus obligations, transfer readiness, and transfer theorem flags.
  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 117 propagation audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  norm criterion propagation, residual criterion propagation, sector criterion
  propagation, common-carrier feed-through propagation, and transfer-readiness
  obligation reduction.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint117_propagation_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint117_propagation_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  Sprint 117 propagates the Sprint116 conditional reducer
  closures into explicit feed records and reduces transfer readiness to a
  precise obligation ledger, but external common-carrier construction,
  common-carrier feed-through, transfer lower-bound, and continuum Hamiltonian
  gap theorems are not proved.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 116 closure-reducer audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  residual convergence closure reduction, norm/gauge window closure reduction,
  sector-stability closure reduction, approximate-inverse closure reduction,
  and common-carrier transfer closure reduction.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint116_closure_reducer_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint116_closure_reducer_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  Sprint 116 compresses the Sprint115 false analytic flags
  into five auditable reducer surfaces and carries the `645120` package
  constant forward, but the external analytic convergence theorems,
  common-carrier construction theorem, and transfer lower-bound theorem are
  not proved.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 115 analytic-supply audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  vanishing-rate ledgers, norm-window closure criteria, projection-sector
  stability criteria, approximate-inverse residual criteria, and common-carrier
  feed-through criteria.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint115_analytic_supply_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint115_analytic_supply_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  Sprint 115 proves internal criterion implications from
  supplied analytic fields and carries the Sprint114 package constant `645120`
  forward, but the external analytic supplies, common-carrier construction
  theorem, and transfer lower-bound theorem are not proved.  Clay/YM promotion
  remains false.

- Sprint 114 closure-criterion audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules
  for gauge-quotient closure criteria, uniform norm constant assembly,
  quadrature residual closure criteria, inverse/projection closure criteria,
  and common-carrier estimate closure assembly.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint114_closure_criterion_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint114_closure_criterion_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  Sprint 114 proves internal criterion implications from
  supplied analytic fields and records `645120` as the local uniform-norm
  package constant, but the external analytic supplies and transfer
  lower-bound theorem are not proved.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 113 estimate-package audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  gauge-covariance/local-section estimates, local Jacobian and
  partition/multiplicity estimates, quotient norm comparison, quadrature
  residual estimates, and inverse/projection residual assembly.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint113_estimate_package_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint113_estimate_package_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  The Sprint112 map-candidate reductions now have a concrete
  estimate package with exact blockers, but the analytic estimates and
  transfer lower-bound theorem are not proved.  Clay/YM promotion remains
  false.

- Sprint 112 map-candidate reduction audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked
  modules for the renormalized interpolation candidate, continuum
  sampling/projection candidate, quotient-independence diagrams, uniform
  norm-bound reduction, and adjointness/approximate-inverse reduction.  The
  generator `scripts/ym_sprint112_map_candidate_reduction_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint112_map_candidate_reduction_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  The common-carrier construction path now has concrete
  candidate recipes and estimate-reduction obligations, but the analytic
  estimates and transfer lower-bound theorem are not proved.  Clay/YM
  promotion remains false.

- Sprint 111 common-carrier construction audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked
  modules for finite-to-continuum embedding/projection maps, gauge quotient and
  physical-sector compatibility, uniform-in-a norm equivalence,
  embedding/projection adjointness and projection stability, and
  common-carrier construction assembly.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint111_common_carrier_construction_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint111_common_carrier_construction_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  The common-carrier layer is now sharpened at the construction
  criteria level, but the analytic construction theorem and transfer
  lower-bound theorem are not proved.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 110 common-carrier compactness audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked
  modules for common carrier Hilbert identification, weak compactness energy
  core, closed-form lower-semicontinuity criterion, recovery core density and
  energy limsup, and bottom-sector threshold/no-collapse.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint110_common_carrier_compactness_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint110_common_carrier_compactness_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  The Mosco/no-pollution package is now split into typed
  common-carrier compactness criteria, but the analytic theorem is not proved.
  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 109 Mosco closure audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  Mosco liminf/lower semicontinuity, recovery sequences,
  no-bottom-spectrum-pollution compactness, Mosco spectral-liminf assembly, and
  transfer lower-bound critical assembly.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint109_mosco_closure_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint109_mosco_closure_audit/` with route decision
  `fail-closed`.  The target `gap(T(a)) >= c * m_eff(a) * a` is now sharpened
  at the Mosco/no-pollution layer, but the analytic theorem is not proved.
  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 108 transfer lower-bound proof-package audit for `2026-06-06`: adds
  checked modules for Mosco/no-pollution, logarithmic generator calculus,
  uniform form lower bound, spectral-gap transport, and transfer lower-bound
  assembly.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint108_transfer_lower_bound_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint108_transfer_lower_bound_audit/` with route decision
  `transfer lower-bound theorem still open`.  The target
  `gap(T(a)) >= c * m_eff(a) * a` is now split into exact typed proof-package
  ledgers, but the analytic theorem is not proved.  Clay/YM promotion remains
  false.

- Sprint 107 finite-continuum uniformity audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked
  modules for the finite-continuum uniformity boundary, uniform transfer
  constant ledger, Hamiltonian spectral-gap bridge, and transfer-gap
  critical-path assembly.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint107_uniformity_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint107_uniformity_audit/` with route decision
  `uniformity theorem still open`.  Sprint 107 records `c_transfer = 1/64`,
  the uniform `a`-window, finite transfer positivity, continuum spectral
  passage boundaries, and the `H(a) = - a^-1 log T(a)` bridge status.  The
  uniform continuum transfer lower-bound theorem remains open.  Clay/YM
  promotion remains false.

- Sprint 106 transfer-gap audit for `2026-06-06`: adds checked modules for
  WC3 effective-mass lower bound, transfer-matrix comparison, transfer-gap
  lower-bound assembly, and symmetry/group audit advance.  The generator
  `scripts/ym_sprint106_transfer_gap_audit.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint106_transfer_gap_audit/` with route decision
  `theorem still open`.  The route data for
  `gap(T(a)) >= c * m_eff(a) * a` is assembled from WC3 effective-mass
  positivity and finite transfer-matrix support, but the uniform continuum
  transfer comparison theorem remains open.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 105 gap-closure plan for `2026-06-06`: consumes the user-supplied
  five-gap math and adds checked bridge modules for non-circular mass-gap
  separation, OS3 spatial-only blocking into Wightman reconstruction status,
  continuum symmetry restoration, and compact simple group parameter rows.
  The generator `scripts/ym_sprint105_gap_closure_plan.py` emits
  `outputs/ym_sprint105_gap_closure_plan/` with route decision
  `SPRINT105_GAP_CLOSURE_PLAN_READY`.  The remaining DASHI-native theorem
  obligations are transfer-gap lower bound, symmetry restoration, and compact
  simple group parameter-table completeness.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 104 no-placeholder Clay dossier builder for `2026-06-06`: committed
  and tagged the Sprint 91-103 freeze as `sprint-103-receipt-freeze`, then
  added `YMSprint104ClayCandidateDossierBuilder`.  The new module and generated
  artifacts build an evidence-backed dependency graph, candidate dossier, and
  red-team checklist from actual Sprint 91-103 modules and summaries.  Open
  Clay requirements are concrete blocked-gap records:
  `blockedWightmanDistributions`, `blockedPoincareCovariance`,
  `blockedSpectrumCondition`, `blockedAllCompactSimpleG`, and
  `blockedNonCircularMassGapProof`.  The current lane remains SU(3)-candidate
  only, external Clay gates remain outside repo authority, and
  `clayYangMillsPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 103 YM inhabited proof-argument receipts for `2026-06-06`: records
  that the user supplied math for all eight Sprint 102 obligations and that
  Sprint 103 implements inhabited proof-argument receipts for them in the repo
  receipt layer.  The eight obligations are CMP98 local oscillation, CMP98
  Haar/probability constant, CMP116 polymer mass, gauge-covariant Dobrushin
  comparison, uniform polymer activity, WC3 uniform cluster summability,
  continuum-limit mass-gap RG bridge, and nontrivial SU(3) continuum measure
  formalisation.  External Clay acceptance remains outside repo authority and
  `clayYangMillsPromoted` remains false.

- Sprint 102 YM proof-obligation index for `2026-06-06`: separates the
  Sprint 91-101 receipt layer from the remaining analytic proof layer.  It
  records eight remaining mathematical obligations plus the external acceptance
  boundary and keeps Clay/YM promotion false.

- Sprint 101 Clay boundary reconciliation for `2026-06-06`: reconciles the
  Sprint 100 terminal rollup with the older `YMClayPromotionBoundary`, keeping
  both surfaces fail-closed for Clay/YM promotion.

- Sprint 100 YM terminal-state rollup for `2026-06-06`: packages the
  Sprint 91-99 chain into one queryable receipt with the internal candidate
  chain complete and Clay/YM promotion still false.

- Sprint 99 external-acceptance terminal boundary for `2026-06-06`: records
  that the remaining `ExternalAcceptanceToken` is not repo-internal and cannot
  be self-issued.  Clay/YM promotion remains false.

- Sprint 98 Clay statement boundary candidate receipt for `2026-06-06`:
  starts the final internal-boundary assembly from the Sprint 97 nontrivial
  SU(3) continuum-measure receipt.  This is not an external Clay promotion.

- Sprint 97 nontrivial SU(3) continuum-measure receipt for `2026-06-06`:
  records the structural non-Gaussianity witness from non-Abelian curvature
  self-interaction after the Sprint 96 continuum mass-gap receipt.  It does not
  discharge the Clay statement or provide external acceptance.

- Sprint 96 continuum-limit mass-gap receipt for `2026-06-06`: records the
  narrow bridge from uniform connected Schwinger decay to the candidate
  continuum mass-gap statement using an RG-generated effective mass,
  transfer-gap/effective-mass comparison, and RG-invariant physical scale.
  It does not derive nontrivial SU(3) continuum measure, Clay statement
  discharge, external acceptance, or Clay/YM promotion.

- Sprint 95 uniform connected Schwinger decay for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint95UniformConnectedSchwingerDecayReceipt` plus a focused audit
  script and test.  The receipt consumes uniform WC3 and records the connected
  Schwinger/Mayer expansion implication to uniform connected Schwinger decay.
  It does not derive `ContinuumLimitMassGap` or Clay/YM promotion.

- Sprint 95 WC3 uniform-in-a summability for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint95WC3UniformInAReceipt` plus a focused audit script and test.  The
  receipt consumes Sprint 94 and the existing blocked `L=2` eta=4 KP carrier,
  records `4q = 0.9271275790105094 < 1`, and closes `WC3UniformInA` in the
  receipt layer.  It does not derive `UniformConnectedSchwingerDecay`,
  `ContinuumLimitMassGap`, or Clay/YM promotion.

- Sprint 94 uniform activity bound for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint94UniformBoundForAllAReceipt` plus a focused audit script and test.
  The receipt consumes the Sprint 93 contraction lower bound and records
  `UniformBoundForAllA` with constants `C = 1/(1-delta_min)` and
  `m = delta_min/2`, where `delta_min = 1 - exp(-4)`.  It does not derive
  `WC3UniformInA`, `UniformConnectedSchwingerDecay`,
  `ContinuumLimitMassGap`, or Clay/YM promotion.

- Sprint 93 contraction-delta lower-bound correction for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint93ContractionDeltaLowerBoundReceipt` plus a focused audit script and
  test.  The receipt accepts `BalabanCMP98AveragingKernelIsProbability` and
  `BalabanCMP116PolymerMassBound` as scoped authority inputs, retires the
  incorrect contraction-delta independence framing, and records the corrected
  lower-bound statement `delta(a) >= delta_min = 1 - exp(-4)` for sufficiently
  small `a`.  It does not derive `UniformBoundForAllA`, `WC3UniformInA`,
  `UniformConnectedSchwingerDecay`, `ContinuumLimitMassGap`, or Clay/YM
  promotion.

- Sprint 92 master-WC3 adjoint correction for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint92MasterWC3AdjointCorrectionReceipt`, replacing the earlier
  SU(3) `k=10` arithmetic candidate.  The corrected row-sum condition applies
  the adjoint factor before testing `18*C_local < exp(-4)`: SU(2) `k=9`
  passes, SU(3) `k=9` fails, SU(3) `k=10` still fails, and SU(3) `k=11`
  passes arithmetically.  The receipt deliberately leaves
  `BalabanQhpLocalConstantBound`, `BalabanCMP116PolymerMassBound`,
  `AdjointRepresentationSharperBound-or-BlockingDepthK11PhysicalValidation`,
  `WeakCouplingWindowSU3`, WC3, no spectral pollution, and
  `clayYangMillsPromoted` false/open.

- Sprint 92 master-WC3 theorem interface for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint92MasterWC3Condition`, making the remaining continuum jump explicit:
  `MasterWC3ConditionSU3AtK11` feeds `GaugeCovariantDobrushinComparison`,
  `UniformPolymerActivityFromDobrushin`, `WC3UniformClusterSummability`, and
  `UniformConnectedSchwingerDecay`, then
  `ContinuumLimitMassGap`.  Added
  `scripts/ym_sprint92_master_wc3_condition.py` and focused tests; the
  generated summary records `eta4_q = 0.9271275790105094`,
  `eta6_q = 1.390691368515764`, `eta8_q = 1.8542551580210187`,
  `su2_first_safe_k = 9`, and `su3_first_safe_k = 11`.  The module now names
  the corrected proof obligations as uninhabited types:
  `ContractionDeltaLowerBound`, `UniformBoundForAllA`, `WC3UniformInA`,
  `UniformConnectedSchwingerDecay`, and `ContinuumLimitMassGap`; the two
  Balaban authority inputs remain `BalabanCMP98AveragingKernelIsProbability`
  and `BalabanCMP116PolymerMassBound`.

- Sprint 91 WC3 new-math program for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint91WC3NewMathReceipt`, recording the Cauchy-Schwarz conversion from
  Sprint-80 quadratic anisotropic oscillation control to a linear Dobrushin
  coefficient.  The receipt calculates the master thresholds
  `exp(-4)/18 = 0.0010175354938185654`,
  `512*exp(-4)/18 = 0.5209781728351055`, and the SU(3) adjoint-adjusted
  threshold `0.23154585459338023`.  It keeps the actual master weak-coupling
  inequality `g^2 < threshold/(C_avg*sqrt(m))`, WC3, no spectral pollution,
  SU(N) extension, and `clayYangMillsPromoted` false/open.

- Sprint 90 continuum WC boundary for `2026-06-06`: added
  `YMSprint90ContinuumMassGapWCBoundaryReceipt`, recording the conditional
  implication from WC3/tightness/reflection positivity/OS reconstruction to
  no spectral pollution and positive continuum mass gap.  The receipt leaves
  `WC3UniformClusterSummability`, unconditional
  `NoSpectralPollutionUnderContinuumLimit`,
  `LatticeGapSurvivesContinuumScaling`,
  `Nontrivial4DSU3YangMillsMeasure`, `SUNGreaterThan2Extension`,
  `ExternalAcceptanceToken`, and `clayYangMillsPromoted` false/open.  The combined audit now includes the
  Sprint 90 surface while keeping the top-level YM gate at the Clay promotion
  boundary.

- Sprint 89 transfer spectral-gap scoped-authority closure for `2026-06-06`:
  added `YMSprint89ScopedAuthorityTransferSpectralGapReceipt`, accepting
  `BalabanCMP98LocalOscillationBoundForQhp` for Assumption 5.4 and
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1` for Assumption 6.3 as scoped
  authority inputs.  `YMLatticeMassGapAuthority` now records
  `TransferSpectralGap`, `PositiveLatticeMassGapExtraction`, and the lattice
  mass-gap provider closed in the receipt/scoped-authority sense.  The weak
  `PolymerIn` Gate-B theorem remains unpromoted, and continuum/OS/Clay gates
  remain false.

- Sprint 86 YM/NS theorem-gate continuation for `2026-06-05`: added
  `YMSprint86BlockedActionTransferKernelSeparationReceipt` and
  `NSSprint86KStarHHalfTailObstructionReceipt`, wired them through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and added focused audit scripts/tests.  YM now
  records the exact `BlockedActionSeparatesTransferKernel` input stack and
  derives `SpatialBlockingCreatesNoNewCrossTerms` from spatial-only
  temporal-link preservation, while leaving
  `ExactBlockedActionTransferResidualSum` open.  Added
  `YMSprint87ExactBlockedActionTransferResidualSumReceipt` to split that exact
  sum into term enumeration, transfer/residual projections, projection
  disjointness, projection cover, and action-sum compatibility.  NS records the
  KStar-admissibility-to-`H^{1/2}` tail obstruction and leaves
  `QhpTailSmallnessAtDangerShell`, `EpsilonBelowOneCoefficient`, and
  `HminusHalfHighHighDefectTheorem` open.  Both Clay promotions remain false.

- Sprint 85 YM transfer/spatial-blocking decomposition for `2026-06-05`:
  added `YMSprint85TemporalTransferSpatialBlockingCompatibilityReceipt` and
  wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt splits
  `TemporalTransferMatrixSpatialBlockingCompatibility` into five sublemmas,
  derives the time-slice and temporal-boundary-link preservation pieces from
  the spatial-only temporal-link receipt.  The later W3/W4/W5 closure now
  closes transfer-kernel separation, Balaban temporal-trace commutation,
  transfer-Hilbert-space compatibility, and full temporal transfer/spatial-
  blocking compatibility.  The combined YM/NS audit exposes this closure while
  keeping the lattice mass-gap provider and Clay/YM promotion fail-closed.

- Sprint 84 NS Qhp semantic correction for `2026-06-05`: the
  spatial-identity Qhp formal commutation package remains recorded, but
  `EpsilonBelowOneCoefficient` and `HminusHalfHighHighDefectTheorem` are empty
  theorem targets again.  The audit route is back to
  `NS_HMINUS_HALF_ONE_SOBOLEV_GAP_QHP_OPEN`, with next gate
  `AnalyticAbsorptionFromQhpCommutation` and Clay/NS promotion false.

- NS fastest Clay path route selection for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSFastestClayPathReceipt.agda` and wired it through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt consumes Sprint 58 normalized-action
  inflation, the `H^-1/2` obstruction receipt, the negative-Sobolev
  danger-shell target, and `NSNonCircularKStarDriftBoundTargetReceipt`. It
  retires packet-normalized action as an active proof source, selects the
  `H^-1/2` high-high defect estimate as the fastest honest decision gate, and
  keeps Clay Navier-Stokes promotion false. The next mathematical decision is
  to prove or analytically refute
  `||P_{>K*}(u.grad u)||_{H^-1/2} <= epsilon*nu*||P_{>K*}u||_{H^3/2}` without
  importing `H^1/2`, Serrin, BKM, or stronger regularity.
  Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSHminusHalfGateDecisionPivotReceipt.agda` as
  the follow-on gate decision/pivot receipt. It records that current repo
  evidence supports Path A as an `H^-1/2` obstruction-theorem output, while the
  active Clay-facing lane is Path B: `H^{11/8}` Bernoulli-band rigour, uniform
  regularity across dense prime-LP approximations, limit stability, and
  NS-to-EV5 forward simulation/preservation. Bernoulli rigour, uniform
  regularity, limit stability, EV5 simulation, and Clay NS remain open.

- Sprint 82 YM residual spatial-support core for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMResidualSpatialSupportCore.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMResidualSpatialSupportCounterexample.agda`,
  `scripts/ym_sprint82_residual_support_evidence_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_ym_sprint82_residual_support_evidence_audit.py`, and generated
  outputs under `outputs/ym_sprint82_residual_support_evidence/`, then wired
  the Agda core through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. This defines typed term/link
  support semantics and proves the conditional chain from temporal absorption
  and temporal-link-use classification to residual spatial-support evidence.
  The evidence records are not derived from the receipt-level machinery, so KP,
  mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman, and Clay/YM remain unpromoted.
  The counterexample proves the current `PolymerIn` relation is too weak for
  unconditional residual spatial support: it permits a temporal-link polymer
  membership witness without an actual residual term resolver.
  Added `YMResidualTermMembershipResolver` and
  `YMResidualSupportEvidenceProvider` to provide that resolver interface and
  the final evidence assembly layer; the remaining open items are the
  Balaban-specific temporal transfer/residual disjointness provider and
  residual membership resolver instance.
  Added `YMResidualSupportBalabanAuthority` to provide those two instances as
  explicit postulated authority assumptions and assemble residual spatial
  support/A1 conditionally. This does not derive the provider instances in
  repo; no blocked-lattice eta=4, KP, mass gap, or Clay/YM promotion follows.
  Added `YMBlockedL2KPEntropy`, which closes blocked-lattice support,
  `KPEntropyAtBlockedScaleL2`, `eta4`, and all-diameter KP on the
  authority-conditional lane. The unconditional lane remains blocked on
  deriving the Balaban provider instances, and no mass gap or Clay/YM promotion
  follows.
  Added `YMSmallFieldSurvivalAuthority`, which advances the
  authority-conditional lane through
  `SmallFieldBoundsSurviveAnisotropicBlocking` from an explicit small-field
  survival provider. The provider now derives spatial blocking compatibility,
  temporal transfer compatibility, and polymer activity preservation from the
  strong KP/sector lane, and splits the remaining authority surface into four
  Balaban analytic theorem slots plus two imported gauge-measure theorem slots
  and one native spatial-orbit slot. This
  remains authority-conditional; the next gate is
  `LatticeMassGapFromAnisotropicKP`, and Clay/YM promotion remains false.
  Added `YMLatticeMassGapAuthority`, which advances that lane through
  `LatticeMassGapFromAnisotropicKP` from four exact transfer/spectral-gap
  theorem slots.  Thermodynamic limit, OS/Wightman reconstruction, continuum
  mass-gap transfer, and Clay/YM promotion remain false.
  Added `YMThermodynamicLimitAuthority`, which advances the
  authority-conditional lane through `ThermodynamicLimit`,
  `ContinuumLimitExists`, and `Nontrivial4DSU3YangMillsMeasure` from an
  explicit thermodynamic-limit provider.  OS axioms, OS/Wightman
  reconstruction, continuum mass-gap transfer, mass-gap survival, and Clay/YM
  promotion remain false.
  Added `YMOSAxiomsAuthority`, which advances the authority-conditional lane
  through `OsterwalderSchraderAxioms` from an explicit OS provider.
  OS/Wightman reconstruction, continuum mass-gap transfer, mass-gap survival,
  and Clay/YM promotion remain false.
  Added `YMOSWightmanReconstructionAuthority`, which advances the
  authority-conditional lane through `OSWightmanReconstruction` and
  `WightmanQFT` from an explicit reconstruction provider.  Continuum mass-gap
  transfer, mass-gap survival, and Clay/YM promotion remain false.
  Added `YMContinuumMassGapTransferAuthority`, which advances the
  authority-conditional lane through `ContinuumMassGapTransfer` and
  `PositiveContinuumMassGap` from an explicit transfer provider.  Mass-gap
  survival and Clay/YM promotion remain false.
  Added `YMMassGapSurvivalAuthority`, which advances the authority-conditional
  lane through `MassGapSurvival` and records a `ClayYangMillsCandidate` surface
  from an explicit survival provider.  Actual `clayYangMillsPromoted` remains
  false.
  Added `YMClayPromotionBoundary`, which records the final fail-closed
  promotion boundary: the candidate is authority-conditional, provider
  derivations remain open, and `clayYangMillsPromoted=false`.
  Added `YMProviderDerivationInRepo`, which supplies the in-repo constructors
  for the two Gate-B provider instances from explicit semantic inputs.  The
  remaining blocker is now sharper: prove
  `ProveTemporalTransferResidualDisjointnessSemantics` and
  `ProveResidualMembershipSemantics`; provider construction itself is no
  longer missing.
  Added `YMProviderSemanticObligations`, which splits those semantic inputs
  into `ProveTemporalAbsorptionSemantics`,
  `ProveTransferResidualExclusionSemantics`, and
  `ProveEveryPolymerInHasResolvedResidualTerm`.  These are the next exact
  in-repo Gate-B sublemmas; current receipt surfaces do not yet provide them.
  Added `YMTemporalTransferSemanticBridge` and
  `YMResolvedMembershipSemantics`.  These narrow the live blockers to a typed
  interpretation of the Sprint 71/78 transfer receipts over `ActionTerm`, plus
  a refinement from weak identifier-only `PolymerIn` to actual residual-term
  list membership.  They prove the corresponding assembly steps but keep
  `DeriveTypedTemporalTransferInterpretation` and
  `ProvePolymerInRefinesToStrongResidualMembership` open.
  Added `YMGateBPackagingResolutionBoundary` to audit the proposed shortcut
  that these are mere packaging gaps.  The module defines the exact
  `GateBPackagingResolutionEvidence` bundle that would close the lane, but
  keeps the shortcut fail-closed because the current receipts expose booleans,
  not term-level residual-exclusion functions, and weak `PolymerIn` is not
  residual-term list membership.
  Added `YMGateBPackagingResolutionAuthority`, which supplies that evidence on
  a narrower authority lane from two named imports: typed Sprint 71/78
  temporal-transfer interpretation and Eriksson/Balaban Prop 3.1
  weak-to-strong residual membership refinement.  This assembles Gate B through
  A1, blocked-L2 entropy, and all-diameter KP conditionally, while leaving the
  in-repo derivation flags and Clay/YM promotion false.
  Added `YMGateBInRepoDerivationAttempts`, which proves
  `TemporalAbsorptionSemantics` from the current `TemporalOrMixedTerm`
  constructor but refutes `TransferResidualExclusionSemantics`, full
  `TypedTemporalTransferInterpretation`, and weak-to-strong `PolymerIn`
  refinement for the current carriers.  The next in-repo work is carrier
  strengthening, not another receipt.
  Added `YMStrongGateBCarriers`, which supplies that strengthened parallel
  path: transfer/residual disjointness is a first-class action-term invariant,
  `StrongResidualPolymerMembership` replaces weak `PolymerIn`, and spatial
  support assembles directly.  The remaining in-repo work is bridging or
  refactoring the legacy weak Gate-B theorem records to consume the strong path.

- Sprint 81D YM effective-action spatial-only bridge for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMEffectiveActionSpatialOnlyBridge.agda`,
  `scripts/ym_sprint81d_effective_action_spatial_only_bridge_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_ym_sprint81d_effective_action_spatial_only_bridge_audit.py`, and
  generated outputs under
  `outputs/ym_sprint81d_effective_action_spatial_only_bridge/`, then wired the
  Agda bridge through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. This proves the conditional
  assembly step from `ResidualEffectiveActionSpatialSupportEvidence` to
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1Theorem`, plus the conditional bridge
  to blocked `L=2` graph membership. The residual-support evidence itself
  remains open, so no KP, mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman, or Clay/YM
  promotion follows.

- Sprint 81C YM typed support interface for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMEffectiveActionSupportInterface.agda` and wired it
  through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. This supplies the first typed carrier layer
  for the Gate-B support theorem, including links, polymers, effective actions,
  residual terms, support predicates, activity locality, temporal-factorization
  reconciliation, and blocked `L=2` graph predicates. It defines conditional
  theorem-record shapes but does not prove `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1`,
  KP, mass gap, or Clay/YM.

- Sprint 81A/B YM conditional authority and support-interface split for
  `2026-06-05`: added a Gate-A conditional authority receipt/audit and a
  Gate-B support-interface receipt/audit. Gate A can now be read as closed only
  relative to an explicit Balaban CMP 98 local-oscillation authority input:
  under that input, the spatial link-count arithmetic yields
  `LipschitzToSquaredOscillationForQhp` and `AnisotropicAssumptionA`. Sprint
  81C then defines the typed support surface for
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1`; the support theorem itself remains
  open. No all-diameter KP, mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman, or
  Clay/YM promotion follows.

- Sprint 81 YM Q_hp local-oscillation proof attempt for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintEightyOneYMBalabanCMP98QhpLocalOscillationReceipt.agda`,
  `scripts/ym_sprint81_qhp_local_oscillation_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_ym_sprint81_qhp_local_oscillation_audit.py`, and generated
  outputs under `outputs/ym_sprint81_qhp_local_oscillation/`. The audit
  attempts the first UV blocker and records the exact missing formal layer:
  gauge-link oscillation seminorm, formal `Q_hp` blocking map, imported CMP 98
  averaging locality, and the Q_hp per-link influence cone. The route remains
  fail-closed; no `AnisotropicAssumptionA`, UV closure, mass gap, or Clay/YM
  promotion follows.

- SeaMeInIt unwrap competitor formalism layer for `2026-06-05`: added the
  split `DASHI/Interop/SeaMeInIt/Unwrap/Competitor/*` surface and wired the
  umbrella through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The layer factors unwrap comparison
  into `Core`, `Methods`, `Benchmark`, `Obligations`, `GarmentGate`,
  claim-boundary, and external-conformance receipts. A competitor is now
  represented as carrier plus
  map contract, metric witness, UFTC severity report, method family, and claim
  boundary. Benchmark aggregation is non-masking: severe failures such as
  foldovers, invalid roundtrip claims, manufacturing failures, or boundary
  violations cannot be hidden by good numeric scores. Wins remain local to the
  declared candidate slice; no global flattening optimum, isometry, true
  inverse, external-solver authority, manufacturing safety, or SeaMeInIt
  production promotion follows.

- SeaMeInIt deterministic sphere unwrap benchmark runner for `2026-06-05`:
  added `scripts/sphere_unwrap_benchmark.py` and
  `tests/test_sphere_unwrap_benchmark.py`. The runner emits JSON receipts over
  ten adversarial spherical fields for BT369/adaptive, cylindrical equal-area,
  equirectangular, cubed-sphere, octahedral, HEALPix when available, and
  diagnostic unavailable optional solvers including xatlas, SLIM, BFF, OptCuts,
  and Blender. In the local sandbox smoke run at `12x6`, BT369 wins 9/10 fields
  and equal-area wins `binary_hemisphere`; HEALPix/xatlas/etc. are unavailable
  diagnostics because their Python packages are not importable here. This is a
  declared benchmark-slice result only; no global optimum, isometry, true
  inverse, external authority, manufacturing safety, or SeaMeInIt production
  promotion follows.

- SeaMeInIt seam derivation formal and diagnostic surface for `2026-06-05`:
  added `DASHI/Interop/SeaMeInItSeamDerivationFormalism.agda`,
  `scripts/seam_derivation_diagnostic.py`, and
  `tests/test_seam_derivation_diagnostic.py`. The formal surface reframes ROM
  as an admissible movement-derivation language rather than a pose set, and
  reframes darts, ease, gussets, pleats, stretch panels, and panel splits as
  discrete metric-correction operators. The intended pipeline is evidence ->
  body/ROM/fabric carrier -> projected fields -> seam-cost graph -> seam and
  panel topology -> flattening residuals -> shaping corrections -> allowances
  -> finished pattern receipt. The runner exercises this shape over a synthetic
  ellipsoid patch and remains diagnostic-only: no external body fit, physical
  safety, manufacturing safety, clinical use, or SeaMeInIt production promotion
  follows.

- Sprint 80 YM Gate-A proof-plan audit for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintEightyYMAnisotropicAssumptionAProofPlanReceipt.agda`,
  `scripts/ym_sprint80_anisotropic_assumption_a_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_ym_sprint80_anisotropic_assumption_a_audit.py`, and generated
  outputs under `outputs/ym_sprint80_anisotropic_assumption_a/`. The audit
  records the exact conditional bound
  `3*L^(3k)*C_local^2*L^(-4k)=3*C_local^2*L^(-k)<=3*C_local^2`, plus the
  `L=2,k=9` ratios. It now also emits the KP guardrail arithmetic
  `eta=4` passes, `eta=6` and `eta=8` fail, and keeps the p0 floor crossing as
  an explicit audit track rather than the active B6 theorem gate. It keeps the
  Balaban CMP 98 local oscillation theorem object, the
  Lipschitz-to-squared-oscillation bridge, `AnisotropicAssumptionA`, UV
  promotion, and Clay/YM promotion false/open.

- Sprint 79 YM anisotropic Assumption A correction for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyNineYMAnisotropicAssumptionAReceipt.agda`
  and extended the current-to-complete audit schema. Eriksson 2602.0077 is now
  recorded as fixed-finite-volume blocked-observable UV closure conditional on
  Assumption A, the squared-oscillation summability bound for the blocking map.
  The new DASHI-native UV target is `AnisotropicAssumptionA` /
  `SquaredOscillationSummabilityForHalfPlaneBlocking` for the half-plane or
  spatial-only Balaban blocking map `Q_hp`. The polymer representation
  hypothesis is source-level discharged by the Balaban/Eriksson package;
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1` remains the KP support/entropy
  subgate needed to earn blocked-scale `eta=4`. No continuum limit, OS,
  thermodynamic-limit, mass-gap, or Clay/YM promotion is closed.

- Sprint 79 YM effective-action support audit for `2026-06-05`: added
  `scripts/ym_sprint79_effective_action_support_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_ym_sprint79_effective_action_support_audit.py`, and generated
  `outputs/ym_sprint79_effective_action_support/ym_sprint79_effective_action_support_table.csv`,
  `outputs/ym_sprint79_effective_action_support/ym_sprint79_kp_graph_entropy_table.csv`,
  and
  `outputs/ym_sprint79_effective_action_support/ym_sprint79_effective_action_spatial_a1_summary.json`.
  The audit is fail-closed: `4q=0.9271275790105094<1` for blocked `L=2`
  `eta=4`, but fine-lattice spatial `eta=6` gives
  `6q=1.390691368515764>1`, and the residual effective-action graph is not
  yet proved spatial-only on the blocked lattice. Current route decision:
  `ANISOTROPIC_KP_ROUTE_BLOCKED`.

- Sprint 79 YM current-to-complete roadmap for `2026-06-05`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyNineYMCurrentToCompleteRoadmapReceipt.agda`,
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyNineYMCurrentToCompleteRoadmap.md`,
  `scripts/ym_sprint79_current_to_complete_roadmap.py`, and
  `tests/test_ym_sprint79_current_to_complete_roadmap.py`. The roadmap records
  the fail-closed KP/support gate chain from
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1` through the mass-gap/Clay endpoint, plus the
  guardrails `4q<1` conditional, `6q>1` blocked, and `8q>1` blocked. It adds
  machine-readable gate/status outputs under
  `outputs/ym_sprint79_current_to_complete/`. No theorem or promotion is
  closed by this roadmap.

- Sprint 78 YM effective-action spatial-only split for `2026-06-05`: added
  and wired the first four Agda receipt surfaces:
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMTemporalTermsAbsorbedReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMResidualEffectiveActionSpatialSupportReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMKPSpatialAdjacencyReceipt`, and
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMEffectiveActionSpatialOnlyReceipt`. These split the
  live A1 theorem into temporal-term transfer absorption, residual
  temporal-support exclusion, KP spatial adjacency, and the assembled
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1` gate. The effective-action receipt
  now treats p0/Nc floor receipts as diagnostic/history surfaces and uses the
  Paper12b B6(A1-A3) conditional surface as the active framing. Each receipt
  keeps the load-bearing theorem false/open. No all-diameter KP, mass gap,
  continuum transfer, OS/Wightman reconstruction, or Clay/YM promotion follows.

- Sprint 78 YM Paper 12b / A1 / entropy correction for `2026-06-05`: added
  and wired `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMTemporalEntropyFromSpatialSupportReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMAllDiameterKPFromSpatialSupportReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMBalabanEndpointAfterSpatialSupportReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMKPEntropyFromL2BlockingOrientationsReceipt`, and
  `ClaySprintSeventyEightYMPaper12bA1EntropyCorrectionReceipt`. These record
  Paper 12b's B6 surface as conditionally closed from A1-A3. The 2602.0077
  correction moves the published-architecture UV gap to blocking-map
  Assumption A; `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnlyForA1` remains the
  KP/support input rather than Eriksson 2602.0077's open Assumption A. The
  entropy convention is
  corrected: fine-lattice spatial entropy has `eta_sp=6`, so
  `6q=1.390691368515764>1` blocks; the favorable `eta=4` / `4q<1` line is
  theorem-relevant only after `KPEntropyAtBlockedScaleL2` /
  `KPEntropyFromL2BlockingOrientations` proves
  blocked-scale `L=2` orientation counting: six spatial block faces minus two
  transfer faces absorbed into `T_k` leaves four KP extension faces. Clay/YM
  remains false.

- Sprint 77/78 YM absorption-floor correction for `2026-06-05`: updated the
  absorption-qualified receipts to record the spacetime floor crossing
  `p0(k=8)=3.057 < 3.079` and `p0(k=9)=3.124 > 3.079`, so the active
  Eriksson/Balaban large-field input starts at `k_start=9`. The finite prefix
  `k=0..8` remains an initial-condition gap unless
  `NcAbsorptionFloorAuthority` is sourced/formalized or a separate finite-scale
  argument is supplied. The live theorem gate is
  `EffectiveActionPolymersSpatialOnly`, followed by
  `KPEntropyFromL2BlockingOrientations` and
  `TemporalEntropyQuotientHalvesGeneric4DCount`. No all-diameter KP, mass gap,
  continuum transfer, OS/Wightman reconstruction, or Clay/YM promotion follows.
  This entry is now historical relative to the Paper12b B6(A1-A3) framing;
  the p0/Nc lane remains useful as a diagnostic side track, not as the active
  B6 theorem gate.

- Sprint 76 six-lane YM completion ladder for `2026-06-05`: added and wired
  the Sprint 76 ladder receipts:
  `ClaySprintSeventySixYMTemporalEntropyQuotientCoreReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventySixYMBalabanTransferCompatibilityReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventySixYMAnisotropicAllDiameterKPReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventySixYMSmallFieldAnisotropicSurvivalReceipt`,
  `ClaySprintSeventySixYMLatticeMassGapFromAnisotropicKPReceipt`, and
  `ClaySprintSeventySixYMContinuumOSMassGapSurvivalReceipt`; added matching
  Sprint 76 docs; and added six worker modules:
  `YMSpatialOnlyBlockingTemporalLinks`,
  `YMTemporalCutsStableUnderBalabanRG`,
  `YMLargeFieldTemporalCutSeparation`,
  `YMBalabanPartitionTemporalTraceCommutation`,
  `YMBalabanTransferCompatibilityTheorem`, and
  `YMTemporalQuotientKPBridge`. W1 packages
  `SpatialOnlyBlockingPreservesTemporalLinks`; W2-W4 now close temporal-cut
  stability, large-field transfer-cut separation on the authority-backed W3
  path, and Balaban trace commutation; W5 therefore closes
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`. W6 records
  the remaining compatibility -> eta=4 -> KP bridge boundary. The
  receipts form a normalized theorem ladder but keep every load-bearing gate
  false: temporal entropy quotient, Balaban compatibility, all-diameter KP,
  small-field survival, lattice mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman,
  mass-gap survival, and Clay/YM promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 75 YM temporal entropy quotient for `2026-06-05`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyFiveYMTemporalEntropyQuotient.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyFiveYMTemporalEntropyQuotientReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt records the
  proof-safe `[3,1]` role split: three spatial directions feed KP
  connected-polymer entropy, while one temporal direction remains the ordered
  transfer trace `Z = Tr(T^Lt)`. It packages the transfer-structure interface
  inputs `SpatialRGLeavesTimeAxisInvariant`,
  `TransferTracePreservedBySpatialRG`,
  `TemporalBoundaryPairingFromReflectionPositivity`, and
  `PlanckScaleTemporalLocalityGuard`; it keeps four-dimensional physics
  explicit: this is not dimension reduction. The exact next theorem stack is
  `TemporalSupportNonCreationForSlabs`,
  `TemporalEntropyQuotientHalvesGeneric4DCount`, and
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`. The receipt
  inherits Sprint 74 arithmetic (`8q = 1.8542551580210187 > 1`,
  `4q = 0.9271275790105094 < 1`) but records `eta=4` as theorem-relevant only
  after temporal quotient and Balaban/transfer-matrix compatibility close.
  All-diameter KP, mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman reconstruction,
  and Clay/YM promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 74 YM KP threshold arithmetic for `2026-06-05`: added
  `scripts/ym_sprint74_kp_threshold_plots.py`, added
  `tests/test_ym_sprint74_kp_threshold_plots.py`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyFourYMKPThresholdArithmetic.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyFourYMKPThresholdArithmeticReceipt.agda`,
  wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and generated threshold artifacts
  under `outputs/sprint74_ym_kp_thresholds/`. The receipt records closed
  arithmetic only: `8q = 1.8542551580210187 > 1`, `4q =
  0.9271275790105094 < 1`, residual threshold `r <
  0.107316402070709`, ten-percent residual ratio
  `0.994944290301034`, and twenty-percent residual ratio
  `1.065154532578283`. The structural gate remains
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`; all-diameter
  KP, mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman reconstruction, and Clay/YM
  promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 73 YM transfer-matrix compatibility gate for `2026-06-05`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyThreeYMTransferMatrixCompatibilityGate.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyThreeYMTransferMatrixCompatibilityGateReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt packages
  `LinkVariableDisjointnessForTemporalFaces` from Sprint 68's
  `r_K = 1 < L = 2` support certificate, and
  `TemporalMeasureFactorizationWithLeakageLambdaOne` from disjoint variables,
  product Haar measure, and corrected temporal-face bookkeeping. The active
  analytic gate is
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`; temporal
  quotient entropy halving, anisotropic/all-diameter KP, small-field survival,
  lattice mass gap, continuum transfer, OS/Wightman reconstruction, and Clay/YM
  promotion remain open/false. The receipt records arXiv `2506.00284v2` as
  withdrawn by arXiv administration and not live competitive evidence, while
  Eriksson-style large-field / Balaban-interface machinery is tracked as a
  useful external source obligation. Clay still lists the problem as unsolved.

- Sprint 72 YM mixed-plaquette absorption for `2026-06-04`: added
  `scripts/ym_sprint72_mixed_plaquette_absorption_audit.py`, added
  `tests/test_ym_sprint72_mixed_plaquette_absorption_audit.py`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyTwoYMMixedPlaquetteAbsorption.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyTwoYMMixedPlaquetteAbsorptionReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. This is now a legacy residual
  fallback audit under the corrected transfer-matrix convention: default face
  absorption gives
  `effective_total_leakage_times_4q = 0.9271275790105094` and route
  `MIXED_PLAQUETTE_ABSORPTION_CONFIRMED`; ten-percent residual leakage gives
  `0.994944290301034` and route
  `RESIDUAL_LEAKAGE_BELOW_10_PERCENT_CONFIRMED`; twenty percent reblocks with
  `1.0651545325782825` and route
  `MIXED_PLAQUETTES_TRUE_LEAKAGE_REBLOCKS_KP`. The receipt keeps
  residual leakage bound, all-diameter KP, mass gap, continuum transfer, and
  Clay/YM promotion open/false. The active Sprint 71 gate is still
  Balaban/transfer-matrix compatibility, not residual mixed-plaquette leakage.

- Sprint 71 YM mixed-plaquette transfer-matrix compatibility for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyOneYMMixedPlaquetteFork.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyOneYMMixedPlaquetteForkReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt recasts the Sprint
  70 finding under corrected transfer-matrix bookkeeping: mixed
  spatial-temporal plaquettes touching a temporal face are temporal-face /
  transfer-matrix action, not residual correction. The legacy
  `1.7130035863183526` leakage value remains only as the old correction-bucket
  diagnostic. The next real gate is
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`, with exact
  temporal measure factorization, link-variable/cutoff disjointness,
  anisotropic Balaban partition identity, all-diameter KP, mass gap, continuum
  transfer, and Clay/YM promotion open/false.

- Sprint 70 YM boundary-correction plaquette audit for `2026-06-04`: added
  `scripts/ym_sprint70_boundary_correction_audit.py`, added
  `scripts/ym_sprint70_boundary_correction_plaquette_audit.py`, added
  `tests/test_ym_sprint70_boundary_correction_plaquette_audit.py`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyYMBoundaryLeakageLemmaReceipt.agda`,
  and generated corrected/legacy outputs under `outputs/`. The audit enumerates
  unit Wilson plaquettes in the `L=2,d=4` anisotropic slab. Corrected default
  bookkeeping records no temporal-spanning plaquettes, treats mixed
  spatial-temporal plaquettes touching a temporal face as transfer-matrix face
  action, and gives `residual_correction_action_total = 0.0`,
  `bookkeeping_lambda = 1.0`, `total_leakage_factor = 1.0`, and
  `total_leakage_times_4q = 0.9271275790105094`. The legacy correction-bucket
  diagnostic still records `total_leakage_times_4q = 1.7130035863183526`, but
  that value is stale bookkeeping, not the active proof obstruction. Temporal
  measure factorization, Balaban/transfer-matrix compatibility, KP closure, and
  Clay/YM promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 70 Clay roadmap lemma stack for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSeventyClayRoadmapLemmaStack.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventyClayRoadmapLemmaStackReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt consolidates the
  archive-owned algebra (`TritInvolution`, `SupportNonCreation`, `No2Cycle`,
  aggregate defect contractivity, admissibility/ultrametric/idempotent
  machinery, and `TemporalSupportNonCreationForSlabs`), the YM P0-P5 ladder,
  and the NS CKN ladder. It records YM as the shortest current in-repo
  Clay-facing target: P0 is the transfer-matrix compatibility chain
  `TemporalFaceFactorizationFromSupportNonCreation`,
  `MixedPlaquettesAreTransferMatrixNotCorrection`,
  `LinkVariableDisjointnessForTemporalFaces`,
  `TemporalMeasureFactorizationWithLeakage`,
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`, and
  `AnisotropicBalabanPartitionIdentity`, with `eta_eff=4` arithmetic remaining
  conditional until temporal measure factorization, Balaban/transfer-matrix
  compatibility, partition identity, and entropy transfer are proved. It also
  records NS as diagnostic/open: diagnostic-to-theorem promotion,
  DASHI-to-incompressible-NS, suitable weak bridge, Riesz pressure control,
  uniform CKN epsilon, continuum refinement stability, CKN regularity, and
  no finite-time blowup remain false. No Clay/YM or Clay/NS promotion follows.

- Sprint 69 YM temporal-face factorization workplan for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtyNineYMTemporalFaceFactorizationWorkplan.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtyNineYMTemporalFaceFactorizationWorkplanReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt consumes Sprint
  68 as a closed input and assigns six worker lanes: support non-creation
  integration, temporal-face POU construction, slab action additivity audit,
  entropy transfer audit, all-diameter weighted KP audit, and downstream
  Balaban/OS/mass-gap boundary audit. It keeps the favorable arithmetic
  `eta=4`, `q=0.23178189475262734`, `eta*q=0.92712758<1` explicitly
  conditional on temporal-face factorization and entropy-count transfer.
  The receipt now records the sharpened lemma ladder:
  `TemporalFacesDisjointForAdmissiblePolymers`,
  `NoTemporalCrossCoupling`, `ProductCutoffFactorizationWithLeakage`,
  `LocalGaugeActionDecomposition`,
  `MixedPlaquettesAreTransferMatrixNotCorrection`,
  `LinkVariableDisjointnessForTemporalFaces`,
  `TemporalMeasureFactorizationWithLeakage`,
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`,
  `LeakageControlledWeightedKPCloses`, `AllDiameterWeightedKP`,
  `SmallFieldBoundsSurviveAnisotropicBlocking`,
  `TemporalTransferMatrixCompatibleWithSpatialBlocking`,
  `LatticeMassGapFromAnisotropicKP`, `ContinuumMassGapTransfer`,
  `OSWightmanReconstruction`, and `MassGapSurvival`. It also
  records the d=3/d=4 boundary: the `L=2,d=3` spatial row can control 4D YM
  only after temporal quotient/factorization is proved; otherwise the
  `L=2,d=4` spacetime row remains blocked with `eta*q=1.85425516`. Temporal
  face factorization is now constant-tracked: `eta_spatial*q =
  0.9271275790105094`, margin `0.07287242098949065`, maximum leakage factor
  `1/(4q) = 1.078600208471055`, safe formal target `1.0785`, per-face budget
  `2.5542115281578237%` under a three-face multiplicative model, and q
  headroom `0.018218105247372662`. It records that `2.5%` per face passes
  while `2.6%` and `3.0%` fail as a historical leakage diagnostic. Sprint 70/71
  later corrects the bookkeeping by recording mixed temporal plaquettes as
  transfer-matrix face action rather than residual correction. The next analytic
  hinge is link-variable disjointness plus temporal measure factorization, then
  `BalabanPartitionIdentityCompatibleWithTemporalTransferMatrix`. Temporal face
  factorization, measure factorization, anisotropic partition identity, temporal
  quotient entropy halving, all-diameter weighted KP, small-field survival,
  transfer-matrix compatibility, lattice mass gap, continuum transfer,
  OS/Wightman reconstruction, mass gap, and Clay/YM promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 68 YM temporal support non-creation for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtyEightYMTemporalSupportNonCreation.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtyEightYMTemporalSupportNonCreationReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt consumes
  `/home/c/Downloads/ym_temporal_support_noncreation_table.csv`,
  `/home/c/Downloads/ym_spatial_slab_entropy_count.csv`, and
  `/home/c/Downloads/ym_slab_geometry.csv`. It records that
  `SupportNonCreation + KernelLocality(r_K=1)` gives
  `TemporalSupportNonCreationForSlabs` for every `L >= 2`: an admissible
  polymer cannot reach both temporal faces of one spatial slab. It also records
  the notation boundary from the CSVs: the closing row is `L=2,d=3`
  (`eta=4`, `eta*q=0.92712758`), representing three spatial directions for
  four-dimensional YM; the `L=2,d=4` row has `eta=8`, `eta*q=1.85425516`, and
  remains blocked. Temporal face factorisation, anisotropic partition of
  unity, all-diameter weighted KP, Balaban RG transfer, OS/Wightman, mass gap,
  and Clay/YM promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 68 NS research-update falsification ledger for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtyEightNSResearchUpdateFalsificationLedger.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtyEightNSResearchUpdateFalsificationLedgerReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt records the
  supplied DASHI-NS research update as a fail-closed falsification ledger:
  child-state trits were effectively binary, normalized packet action was
  non-additive, vessel/raw-action correction did not close summability,
  BT/smoothed reassignment did not move sigma, direction coherence failed, and
  cross-shell parent credit amplified rather than contracted. The surviving
  proof gates are the physical bridge `Q_K <= C R_K`, source summability
  `R_{K+1} <= c R_K` with `c < 1/sqrt(2)`, non-Beltrami coherent-tube
  depletion, uniform CKN epsilon authority, and the upstream DASHI-to-fluid
  derivation. No no-blowup theorem or Clay/NS promotion follows.

- Sprint 67B NS CKN uniformity audit for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtySevenNSCKNUniformityAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtySevenNSCKNUniformityAuditReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt records both the
  pooled Sprint 66 hot-spot evidence (`80/80` decaying, `0` concentrating,
  Wilson upper sampled-failure bound `0.0458`) and the bounded Sprint 67B
  replay over Sprint 64 ascended candidates: `1536/1536` cylinders decay under
  zoom across `120` clusters, with `flat_count = 0`,
  `concentrating_count = 0`, `persistent_cluster_count = 0`,
  `pressure_fraction_max = 0.13074814940071125`, and max `C_total` decreasing
  from N32 `0.6157542190448191` to N64 `0.2939492011581624`. Uniform CKN
  epsilon, theorem-level pressure control, suitable weak solution bridge,
  no-blowup, and Clay/NS promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 67C YM weighted KP/Balaban algebra for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtySevenYMWeightedKPBalaban.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtySevenYMWeightedKPBalabanReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt pins the YM gate:
  `q = 0.23178189475262734`, generic entropy `eta = 8`, and `8q =
  1.8542551580210187 > 1`. The receipt now demotes the beta-gap framing: the
  threshold is `eta < 4.31440083388422038`, and a spatial-only anisotropic
  Balaban `L = 2` entropy count would give `eta_eff = 4.0`, `4q =
  0.9271275790105094 < 1`, with margin `0.07287242098949064`. The Eriksson
  February 2026 lattice series is recorded as conditional calibration only:
  it points to anisotropic Balaban partition identity, temporal transfer-matrix
  compatibility, small-field bound survival, and reflection positivity under
  spatial-only blocking. The first gate is now `TemporalIntegralFactors`:
  carrier admissibility/support non-creation must rule out polymers crossing
  both a spatial block boundary and a temporal link before Paper II's
  large-field suppression can be transferred to spatial-only blocking.
  The sharpened geometric condition is `TemporalFaceSupport`: no polymer may
  occupy both top and bottom temporal faces of one spatial block.  The receipt
  also records beta `33/2 = 16.5` as the SU3 one-loop plateau and `9` versus
  `27` face geometry as calibration only.
  Weighted KP arithmetic is conditionally closed at `eta = 4`, but temporal
  factorization, anisotropic compatibility, lattice mass gap, continuum
  transfer, mass gap, and Clay/YM promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 67 NS CKN lemma/test ladder for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtySevenNSCKNLemmaTestLadder.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtySevenNSCKNLemmaTestLadderReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The ledger records the
  surviving NS route as CKN/local critical concentration, keeps Sprint 65
  pressure reconstruction as a regression gate, inherits Sprint 66
  decay-under-zoom diagnostics, and names the remaining proof/test obligations:
  candidate coverage, persistent ascension, Riesz pressure control, local
  energy inequality residual, uniform CKN epsilon authority, N-ladder
  refinement stability, suitable weak solution bridge, and conditional
  no-blowup. CKN epsilon regularity, suitable weak solution bridge, continuum
  uniformity, no-finite-time-blowup, and Clay/NS promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 67 DASHI-to-fluid derivation receipt for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtySevenDASHIFluidDerivation.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtySevenDASHIFluidDerivationReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt records the
  first-principles interface ladder from DASHI carrier machinery to an
  admissible continuum fluid law: carrier-to-field reconstruction, support
  non-creation, admissibility invariance, mass/incompressibility, momentum
  advection, pressure as projection defect, isotropic defect descent as the
  Laplacian/viscosity assumption, and CKN as downstream regularity only.
  Carrier convergence, conservation-to-PDE passage, pressure multiplier proof,
  Laplacian limit, derived incompressible Navier-Stokes, CKN theorem
  application, no-blowup, and Clay/NS promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 66 NS CKN r-sweep calibration for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtySixNSCKNRSweepCalibration.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtySixNSCKNRSweepCalibrationReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. dashiCFD now samples
  pressure-inclusive CKN-style hot spots across several radii using
  `C(r) = r^-2 integral_Q (|u|^3 + |p|^(3/2)) dx dt`. Available artifacts
  route as `CKN_R_SWEEP_DECAYS_UNDER_ZOOM`: six-run N32/N64 has
  `decaying_hotspot_count = 60` and `concentrating_hotspot_count = 0`; N128
  seed0 and dense N64 seed0 each have `decaying_hotspot_count = 10` and
  `concentrating_hotspot_count = 0`. This is favorable diagnostic evidence
  only. CKN epsilon regularity, suitable weak solution bridge, continuum
  uniformity, no-finite-time-blowup, and Clay/NS promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 64C YM weighted KP/Balaban path for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtyFourYMWeightedKPBalabanPath.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtyFourYMWeightedKPBalabanPathReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The ledger consumes Sprint 55
  and records YM as the current clean in-repo analytic lane:
  `q = 0.23178189475262734 < 1` is insufficient because `8q =
  1.8542551580210187 > 1`; the weighted KP gate is `8q < 1`, requiring
  `beta_blocked >= 19.251582989089552` under current constants. Balaban
  transfer from physical beta `6.0`, activity/leakage preservation,
  all-diameter KP, continuum rho/leakage, OS/Wightman, mass gap, and Clay/YM
  promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 61 pressure-Hessian Q anti-twist gate for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtyOnePressureHessianQAntiTwistGate.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtyOnePressureHessianQAntiTwistGateReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. This precision update records
  `Q_P = e2 dot Htf e1` as the load-bearing high-red-packet observable, while
  `direction_change_integral_total = 38406.84183964504` is retained only as a
  supporting proxy. Sprint 61 must now measure `Q_P_mean < 0` on the `641`
  high-raw-red packets, `fraction_lambda2_nonpositive`, and
  `omega_theta_bar_sign` as the anti-twist proxy. Hypothesis D, Hypothesis G,
  Hypothesis S, Kleis-to-CFM bridge, BKM transfer, no-blowup, and Clay/NS
  promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 61 CFM direction-coherence route for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixtyOneCFMDirectionCoherenceRoute.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixtyOneCFMDirectionCoherenceRouteReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The ledger records Sprint 60's
  decisive source-budget diagnosis: `sigma_euclidean = -0.0232`,
  `sigma_smoothed = -0.0226`, and `sigma_bt_ultrametric = -0.0312`, with raw
  action conserved across reassignment. The BT-ultrametric shell reassignment
  therefore falsifies the shell-artifact explanation rather than rescuing the
  source budget at current N32/N64 resolution. The live NS route is now CFM
  direction coherence on the `641` red packets, with
  `redirection_without_overwhelm_count = 790` and
  `direction_change_integral_total = 38406.84183964504` as evidence to audit.
  `AngularRedirectionWithoutStretchHarmless`, CFM Lipschitz bridge, geometric
  depletion, BKM transfer, no-blowup, and Clay/NS promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 58 normalized packet-action inflation for `2026-06-04`: added
  `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_sprint58_normalized_action_inflation_audit.py`,
  extended `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with
  `--replay-sprint58-normalized-action-inflation-summary`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyEightNormalizedActionInflation.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyEightNormalizedActionInflationReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The six-run N32/N64 batch
  routes as `NORMALIZED_ACTION_NONADDITIVE_RATIO_INFLATION`:
  `sum_ratios_over_ratio_of_sums_covered = 4904.346096600663`,
  `sum_ratios_over_ratio_of_sums_global = 11471.817018880183`, and
  `low_enstrophy_denominator_fraction = 0.012394729693018202`. This records
  that Sprint 56's packet-normalized source ledger is structurally
  non-additive at vessel level. No Clay/NS promotion follows.

- Sprint 57 vessel/action reconciliation for `2026-06-04`: added
  `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_sprint57_vessel_action_reconciliation_audit.py`,
  extended `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with
  `--replay-sprint57-vessel-action-summary`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftySevenVesselActionReconciliation.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftySevenVesselActionReconciliationReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The six-run N32/N64 batch
  routes as `PACKET_ACTION_UNDERCOUNTS_COVERED_STRETCH`:
  `epsilon_raw_positive_vs_covered = -0.8161321565334568`,
  `epsilon_raw_positive_vs_global = -0.9608719590659198`, while
  `epsilon_normalized_positive_vs_global = 113.58553013012235`. This records a
  normalized packet-action versus raw vessel-action mismatch, not a Clay/NS
  promotion.

- Sprint 56 two-lane physical intuition and reality ledger for `2026-06-04`:
  added `Docs/ClaySprintFiftySixTwoLanePhysicalIntuitionRealityLedger.md`,
  added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftySixTwoLanePhysicalIntuitionRealityLedgerReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The ledger records the physical
  reading after Sprint 56: NS danger is packet-local accumulated positive
  stretch action, not instantaneous color flips, but the current packet-local
  replay is `PACKET_LOCAL_ACTION_SUMMABILITY_BLOCKED` with
  `action_small_fraction = 0.8108028335301063`, `dangerous_lineage_count =
  641`, and `sigma_packet_local_action_fit = -0.4822543927548197`. YM remains
  the energy-vs-entropy KP lane: `q = 0.23178189475262734 < 1`, but
  `8q = 1.8542551580210187 > 1`, requiring beta about
  `19.251582989089552` plus Balaban transfer. The receipt also records six
  bounded worker lanes and keeps NS/YM/terminal/Clay promotion false.

- Sprint 56 NS packet-local accumulated stretch-action audit for `2026-06-04`:
  added `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_sprint56_packet_local_stretch_action_audit.py`,
  extended `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with
  `--replay-sprint56-packet-local-action-summary`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftySixPacketLocalStretchActionAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftySixPacketLocalStretchActionAuditReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The six-run N32/N64 GPU batch
  routes as `PACKET_LOCAL_ACTION_SUMMABILITY_BLOCKED`: packet masks reconstruct
  from Sprint 49 `K_cell` geometry with `packet_local_available_fraction =
  1.0`, but `action_small_fraction = 0.8108028335301063`,
  `dangerous_lineage_count = 641`, and `sigma_packet_local_action_fit =
  -0.4822543927548197`. No weighted packet-local action summability, physical
  bridge, stretch absorption, no finite-time blowup, or Clay/NS promotion
  follows.

- Sprint 55 two-lane localized lemma ledger for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyFiveTwoLaneLocalizedLemmaLedger.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyFiveTwoLaneLocalizedLemmaLedgerReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The ledger consumes the NS
  accumulated-stretch-action receipt and the YM KP-sum receipt, recording the
  live blockers as packet-local/dense-cadence accumulated positive stretch
  summability for NS and weighted KP sum convergence plus
  `BalabanRGScaleTransferToBeta19252` for YM. No NS/YM/Clay promotion follows.

- Sprint 55 NS Lagrangian accumulated stretch-action audit for `2026-06-04`:
  added `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_sprint55_lagrangian_stretch_action_audit.py`,
  extended `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with
  `--replay-sprint55-lagrangian-action-summary`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyFiveLagrangianStretchActionAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyFiveLagrangianStretchActionAuditReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The six-run N32/N64 GPU batch
  routes as `LAGRANGIAN_STRETCH_ACTION_SMALL_DIAGNOSTIC`, with
  `action_small_fraction = 0.9985242030696576`, `dangerous_lineage_count = 5`,
  and `sigma_action_fit = -0.5102412568825301`. Sprint 55 demotes
  instantaneous red/green/blue strings to labels derived after accumulated
  stretch-action integration. Packet-local masks, weighted action summability,
  physical bridge, stretch absorption, no finite-time blowup, and Clay/NS
  promotion remain open/false.

- Sprint 55 YM KP sum convergence correction for `2026-06-04`: updated
  `scripts/ym_sprint54_blocked_kp_transfer_table.py` to emit
  `activity_ratio_q`, `weighted_kp_sum_ratio`, `beta_needed_for_kp_sum`, and
  pass/fail flags. Added `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyFiveYMKPSumConvergence.md`,
  added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyFiveYMKPSumConvergenceReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The corrected p=7,
  branching=8, c_combo=8 row at beta `16.7` has
  `q = 0.23178189475262734 < 1` but
  `branching*q = 1.8542551580210187 > 1`; the weighted KP sum diverges and
  the corrected beta threshold is `19.251582989089552`. No all-diameter KP
  certificate, Balaban RG transfer, continuum YM, mass gap, or Clay YM
  promotion follows.

- Sprint 54 NS/YM pivot roadmap for `2026-06-04`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyFourNSYMPivotRoadmap.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyFourNSYMPivotRoadmapReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The receipt records the NS
  ternary source-budget route as falsified under current material-packet
  physical-amplitude diagnostics, retains NS CFM direction/coherence and
  BKM/no-concentration as fallback lanes, and marks YM KP/Balaban as the main
  analytic lane. No Clay/NS/YM promotion follows.

- Sprint 54 YM inductive diameter KP target for `2026-06-04`: added
  `scripts/ym_sprint54_blocked_kp_transfer_table.py`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyFourYMInductiveDiameterKP.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyFourYMInductiveDiameterKPReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The table separates
  `beta_bare = 6.0` from blocked/carrier beta rows. Literal bare and literal
  blocked Wilson-defect activity pass zero rows; blocked contour/action
  activity passes at beta `13.64` and `16.7`; both passing rows require
  Balaban RG transfer. The receipt records `geometricRatioUniform`,
  `qBelowOne`, `AllDiameterKPActivityBound`, and `BalabanRGScaleTransfer` as
  open, with no YM/Clay promotion.

- Sprint 53 NS/YM fork interpretation for `2026-06-04`: recorded the
  no-2-cycle physical-amplitude result as falsifying the DASHI ternary
  source-budget NS route under current material-packet diagnostics
  (`sigma_physical_cycle_fit = -1.1215088689186317`, physical-small fraction
  `0.3423412506059137`). The remaining NS cadence audit is a falsification
  check, not a promotion. The YM lane is now the clean analytic fallback, but
  the literal Wilson-defect arithmetic is corrected: carrier beta passes only
  for the suppressive weight/envelope, not for `|exp(-beta*S)-1|`.

- Sprint 53 YM diameter-1/2 KP activity for `2026-06-04`: added
  `scripts/ym_diameter_kp_activity_estimator.py`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiftyThreeYMDiameterOneKP.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyThreeYMDiameterOneKPReceipt.agda`,
  and wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The estimator emits
  literal Wilson-defect activity, unit-plaquette suppressive weight, and the
  contour/action KP envelope side by side at beta
  `6.0, 7.69, 10.13, 13.64, 16.7`. Literal activity fails the branch check for
  every row, including the unit-plaquette carrier row
  `8*|exp(-16.7)-1| ~= 7.99999955`; the suppressive carrier weight
  `8*exp(-16.7) ~= 4.47e-7` passes. The contour/action envelope clears
  same-prime `p=7` at beta `10.13` but not `p+1=8`, and clears the
  finite-prefix `p+1` branch check at beta `13.64` and `16.7`. No
  all-diameter KP certificate, Balaban RG transfer, continuum YM, mass gap, or
  Clay YM promotion is certified.

- Sprint 49 material-parent replay for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with
  `--replay-material-parent-summary`, `ns_material_parent_summary.csv`,
  `ns_material_parent_summary.json`, replay checks, and manifest alignment.
  Added `Docs/ClaySprintFortyNineMaterialParentReplay.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyNineMaterialParentReplayReceipt.agda`,
  and wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The replay consumes
  GPU-produced `dashiCFD` parent summaries, reports `sigma_true_new`,
  `sigma_tracking_uncertain`, `sigma_cross_shell`, `sigma_low_shell`, and
  `sigma_total_material`, and explicitly skips N64 CPU shell/packet reruns.
  No source summability, physical bridge, stretch absorption, no-blowup, or
  Clay promotion is certified.

- Sprint 48 NS replenishment decomposition for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with
  `--replenishment-decomposition-audit`, lightweight
  `--replay-packet-summary`, `ns_replenishment_decomposition.csv`, and
  `ns_replenishment_summary.json`. Added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyEightReplenishmentDecomposition.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyEightReplenishmentDecompositionReceipt.agda`,
  and wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The audit decomposes
  Sprint 47 `s_eff` into zero-to-plus, minus-to-plus, and new-unmatched
  positive source channels, reports weighted component source prefixes, and
  fits per-component observed-prefix shell exponents. The replay mode consumes
  existing `ns_packet_transition_summary.csv` files and skips truth loading,
  FFT shell projection, and packet generation. No material lineage, weighted
  source summability, stretch absorption, no-blowup, or Clay promotion is
  certified.

- Sprint 47A/47B strategic fork for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with `--packet-lineage-audit`,
  `ns_packet_transition_table.csv`, `ns_packet_transition_summary.csv`, and
  `ns_packet_transition_summary.json`.  Added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortySevenPacketLineageAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortySevenPacketLineageAuditReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintFortySevenYMAllDiameterKP.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortySevenYMAllDiameterKPReceipt.agda`,
  and wired both receipts through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The NS lane now
  records coarse physical packet transitions, `M_plus_plus`, replenishment
  terms, weighted source prefix, and fail-closed BT/braid placeholders.  The YM
  lane records `AllDiameterKPActivityBound` as the next theorem/certificate
  target without changing the YM harness.  No promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 46 NS source-decay search for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with `--source-decay-search`,
  `ns_source_decay_search.csv`, and `ns_source_decay_summary.json`.  Added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortySixSourceDecaySearch.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortySixSourceDecaySearchReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The audit records
  adjacent-shell red persistence `rho_K`, angular coherence decay,
  pressure-survival decay, BT eta unavailability, candidate budget diagnostics,
  and no-double-counting/no-budget-credit governance.  N32 seed0 shows zero
  angular and pressure decay; N64 seed0/seed1 show only weak subcritical
  pressure-survival decay (`0.04726` and `0.03289`), far below the
  half-derivative target.  No candidate receives budget credit, and no
  promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 45 NS budget component audit for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with `--budget-component-audit`,
  `--residue-key`, `--budget-primes`, and
  `ns_budget_component_audit.csv`.  Added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyFiveBudgetComponentAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyFiveBudgetComponentAuditReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The audit records
  `gamma_fit`, `eta_fit_by_p`, `beta_fit`, gamma-only/eta-only/guarded
  independent budgets, half-derivative budget gaps, and the
  no-double-counting guard.  On N32 seed0 and N64 seed0 with
  `Rplus_stretchSign`, measured `gamma_fit` is zero and same-observable
  `eta*log2(p)` is zero for every tested prime; N64 seed1 repeats the same
  result with worst gap `0.5017769118671768`.  The budget remains about half a
  derivative short.  No promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 44 NS residue semantics audit for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` with `--residue-semantics-audit`,
  theta-grid rows, pressure-high thresholding, explicit `zeroR_positiveQ`
  accounting, `ns_residue_semantics_wide.csv`, and
  `ns_residue_theta_grid_summary.csv`.  Added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyFourResidueSemanticsAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyFourResidueSemanticsAuditReceipt.agda`,
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The audit compares
  `Rplus_strict`, `Rplus_strain`, `Rplus_stretchSign`,
  `Rplus_pressureRelaxed`, and `Rplus_noPressure` under the same physical
  `Q_K` bridge.  N32 and N64 seed0/seed1 were replayed under the Sprint 44
  artifact root; strict red hits `zeroR_positiveQ`, while stretch-sign/strain
  make most ratios finite but remain diagnostic-only and budget-failing.  No
  promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 43 NS residue semantics audit for `2026-06-04`: extended
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` to emit
  `ns_residue_semantics_audit.csv`, `ns_residue_semantics_wide.csv`, and
  `ns_residue_theta_grid_summary.csv`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyThreeNSResidueSemanticsAudit.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyFourResidueSemanticsAuditReceipt.agda`,
  added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyThreeNSResidueSemanticsAuditReceipt.agda`,
  and wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The audit compares
  `Rplus_strict`, `Rplus_strain`, `Rplus_stretchSign`,
  `Rplus_pressureRelaxed`, and `Rplus_noPressure` over theta
  `0, 0.25, 0.5, 1`.  On N64 seed0/seed1, strict and pressure-relaxed
  semantics fail with zero `Rplus` and positive `Q` on 208 / 728 rows;
  strain/no-pressure/stretch-sign make ratios finite on 702 / 728 rows, but
  all audited budgets remain `<= 1/2`.  No promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 43 NS 3D truth bridge repair for `2026-06-04`: repaired
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` so 3D `make_truth_3d.py` artifacts use
  integer-radius shell labels, `meta_json.k_star`, and stored
  `velocity_snapshots`, added progress/ETA with `--progress-every`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyThreeNS3DTruthBridgeRepair.md`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyThreeNS3DTruthBridgeRepairReceipt.agda`,
  and wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The sibling
  dashiCFD truth generator progress now includes ETA, and N64 seed0/seed1 3D
  truth artifacts were generated.  Repaired N32 and N64 runs clear the shell
  metadata and high-shell support blockers, but all remain
  `NO_PROMOTION_BUDGET_FAIL`; no NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion
  flags changed.

- Sprint 43 YM all-diameter KP/rho/leakage harness for `2026-06-03`: added
  `scripts/ym_all_diameter_kp_rho_leakage_harness.py`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyThreeYMAllDiameterHarnessReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintFortyThreeYMAllDiameterKPRhoLeakageHarness.md`, added
  the Sprint 43 artifact contract under
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint43_ym_all_diameter_kp/`, and wired
  the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The harness computes the
  p=7 all-diameter geometric KP tail, strict log margin, rho target, leakage
  tail, connected-animal side diagnostic, and explicit proof-certificate gate
  from local CSV or smoke rows.  Finite D1-D3 evidence remains diagnostic
  only; actual all-diameter Wilson activity, uniform constants,
  continuum-uniform rho/leakage, Balaban transfer, OS/Wightman, mass gap, and
  all Clay/YM promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 40 bridge-budget estimator run for `2026-06-03`: upgraded
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py` to emit `ns_bridge_budget_table.csv` with
  the requested Sprint 40 fields, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyBridgeBudgetEstimatorRun.md`, and generated
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint40_bridge_budget/`.  The two real
  tail-resolved `../dashiCFD` N32 traces resolve `K_star = 2` but contain only
  three nonzero shells `[2,3,4]` at or above `K_star`, below the five-shell fit
  gate, and remain `2d_scalar_fail_closed_no_3d_stretching`.  The synthetic
  3D smoke path executes but is not a physical trace and fails the budget/high
  shell gates.  No promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 42 NS diagnostic harness / bridge falsifier for `2026-06-03`: added
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py`, added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyTwoNSDiagnosticHarnessReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintFortyTwoNSDiagnosticHarness.md`, and wired the receipt
  through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The harness consumes truth NPZ artifacts
  with `omega_snapshots` and `steps`, emits the exact per-shell diagnostic
  table for `Q_K`, ternary residue, adjusted `C_K`, transition/source rows,
  weighted `s_eff`, `rho_K`, and concentration-adjusted `budget_K`, and writes
  JSON checks/manifest files.  Current `../dashiCFD` 2D scalar-vorticity truth
  artifacts are explicitly fail-closed for the 3D physical stretching bridge;
  the 3D vector branch is a direct spectral diagnostic and not a theorem.
  Physical bridge, actual lineage transition/source estimates, high-shell
  budget, stretch absorption, no-blowup, and all Clay promotion flags remain
  false.

- Sprint 40 four-subagent packet run for `2026-06-03`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortySubagentPackets.md` and four lane packets under
  `Docs/worker-packets/`: `NSPhysicalBridgePacket.md`,
  `NSBudgetEstimatePacket.md`, `Gate3BridgePacket.md`, and
  `YMNonperturbativePacket.md`.  The assigned lanes covered the NS physical
  bridge, NS high-shell budget, Gate3 PAWOTG/Mosco/no-pollution bridge, and YM
  nonperturbative KP/Balaban/OS-Wightman options.  All lanes completed
  fail-closed: no actual NS bridge or high-shell `gamma/eta/beta` budget was
  found, Gate3 remains blocked on PAWOTG uniform separation plus
  Mosco/no-pollution/mass-shell transfer, and YM remains blocked on actual
  all-diameter KP or Balaban/OS-Wightman transfer.  No promotion flags changed.

- Sprint 40 calculation harvest for `2026-06-03`: added
  `Docs/ClaySprintFortyCalculationHarvest.md` and generated
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint40_calc/` from local/sibling
  `../dashiCFD` diagnostics.  The run covers the NS theta full sweep, NS EV5
  shell enstrophy on the existing CPU truth trace, Gate3 finite atom-frame
  sweep through `N = 64`, YM p=7 diameter 1 and 2 polymer enumeration, and the
  YM p=7 diameter 1 through 3 activity-bound table.  The outputs localize
  blockers but do not promote any Clay, NS, YM, Gate3, or terminal theorem:
  NS remains boundary/low-shell or unavailable at `K_star`, Gate3 remains
  clustered, and YM remains finite/local rather than all-diameter.

- Sprint 40 highest-alpha six-lane attempt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFortyHighestAlphaSixLaneAttemptReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintFortyHighestAlphaSixLaneAttempt.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 39 and
  the final analytic frontier map, records the requested six-lane Clay push,
  adds explicit derivation packets for W1 physical bridge/counterexample, W2
  aligned concentration `beta`, W3 braid/angular `gamma`, W4 BT ultrametric
  `eta`, W5 budget/replenishment, and W6 governance, and returns exact
  uninhabited blockers for the NS bridge/budget,
  no-replenishment/coherent-tube route, Gate3 PAWOTG/Mosco/no-pollution, and YM
  actual activity/Balaban/OS-Wightman transfer.  No NS, YM, Gate3, terminal, or
  Clay claim was promoted from support arithmetic, diagnostics, or receipt
  algebra; Lean-port work remains out of scope and external artifacts remain
  context only.

- Sprint 39 concentration source budget for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyNineConcentrationSourceBudgetReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyNineConcentrationSourceBudget.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 38,
  records the master inequality
  `gamma + eta*log_2(p) - theta*beta > 1/2`, records source factorization into
  braid/angular depletion, ultrametric decay, and concentration penalty,
  records the concentration-aware physical bridge shape, and makes aligned
  mass concentration a first-class gate.  Concentration bounds,
  concentration-aware bridge, actual gamma/eta/beta estimates, replenishment,
  coherent-tube exclusion, Gate3 Mosco/no-pollution, YM nonperturbative
  rho/leakage, Lean-port work, and all promotions remain false.

- Sprint 38 source-decay / physical-bridge audit for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyEightSourceDecayPhysicalBridgeAuditReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyEightSourceDecayPhysicalBridgeAudit.md`, and
  wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes
  Sprint 37, records polynomial source decay as non-closing, records
  exponential source closure at `sigma > 1/2`, records the source tail cutoff
  formula, records positive transition with exponential source under
  `c*sqrt2 < 1`, records ultrametric source closure at `eta > log_p(sqrt2)`,
  and records braid-lineage with amplification closure at
  `rho*2^(1/2+a) < 1`.  Physical bridge, actual source decay, no
  replenishment, non-Beltrami persistence, Gate3 Mosco/no-pollution, YM
  nonperturbative rho/leakage, Lean-port work, and all promotions remain
  false.

- Sprint 37 oblique exponent / ultrametric source decay for `2026-06-03`:
  added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtySevenObliqueExponentUltrametricSourceDecayReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtySevenObliqueExponentUltrametricSourceDecay.md`,
  and wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes
  Sprint 36, records the source exponent threshold `sigma > 1/2`, records the
  positive transition with power source, records the kernel/concentration
  criterion `mu - theta*beta > 1/2`, and records 369 cube bad-state fraction,
  braid quotient growth, BT ultrametric decay, and tetration scale-jump cost as
  candidate source-decay mechanisms only.  `Q_K <= C R_K^+`, actual oblique
  source decay, actual kernel/concentration bounds, ultrametric-braid source
  decay for NS, Gate3 Mosco/no-pollution, YM nonperturbative rho/leakage,
  Lean-port work, and all promotions remain false.

- Sprint 36 ternary transition / oblique source budget for `2026-06-03`:
  added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtySixTernaryTransitionObliqueSourceBudgetReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtySixTernaryTransitionObliqueSourceBudget.md`, and
  wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes
  Sprint 35, records the correction `per-shell bad fraction != bad-lineage
  probability`, records the positive transition row, records the closeable
  transition/source-budget algebra
  `R^+_(K+1) <= cR^+_K + s_K` with `c*sqrt2 < 1` plus weighted source
  summability, records constant positive oblique fraction as non-closing, and
  records oblique/effective source functionals.  Physical bridge, persistence
  threshold, weighted source summability for actual NS, no concentration,
  oblique cross-shell decay, Gate3 Mosco/no-pollution, YM nonperturbative
  rho/leakage, Lean-port work, and all promotions remain false.

- Sprint 35 no-coherence-replenishment audit for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyFiveNoCoherenceReplenishmentAuditReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyFiveNoCoherenceReplenishmentAudit.md`, and wired
  the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 34,
  records the forced red-bucket equation
  `d/dt R_K^+ <= - gamma_K * R_K^+ + F_K`, records the replenishment tolerance
  `2 * (gamma_K - eta_K) * T_nl > log sqrt2`, records
  subquadratic-strain high-shell coercivity as conditional/order support, and
  adds `NoAlignedMassConcentration` as an open blocker because 3D Bernstein
  alone gives the too-weak `beta = 3`.  Gate3 power-law density and YM
  safe-scale correction budget are carried forward only; `Q_K <= C R_K^+`,
  no-replenishment, no concentration, actual dynamic residue decay, Gate3
  Mosco/no-pollution, YM nonperturbative rho/leakage, Lean-port work, and all
  promotions remain false.

- Sprint 34 direction mixing and replenishment frontier for `2026-06-03`:
  added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyFourDirectionMixingReplenishmentReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyFourDirectionMixingReplenishment.md`, and wired
  the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 33,
  records frozen-eigenframe alignment as a support calculation, corrects full
  NS angle dynamics with a `FrameRotationTerm`, records direction-diffusion
  coercivity as conditional on amplitude-coupling absorption and high-shell
  strain bounds, and names `NoCoherenceReplenishmentAtHighShells` as the hard
  frontier equivalent to `NonBeltramiCoherentTubeCannotPersist`.  Eigenframe
  rotation control, amplitude-coupling absorption, no-replenishment, dynamic
  residue decay, Gate3 closure, YM uniformity, Lean-port work, and all
  promotions remain false.  Sprint 34 is recorded as NS-only: no new Gate3/YM
  progress, solved toy/algebraic/conditional items are not promotion evidence,
  and external artifacts remain context only.

- Sprint 33 consolidated micro-closure ledger for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyThreeConsolidatedMicroClosureLedgerReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyThreeConsolidatedMicroClosureLedger.md`, and
  wired the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes
  Sprint 32 and consolidates the closed NS algebra/conditional pieces, Gate3
  power-law fill-distance limit zero, and YM correction-budget arithmetic.  It
  records conditional stretch absorption while keeping both required inputs
  false, carries the Gate3 witness table, carries the YM safe-scale and
  `k=120` diagnostic rows, and names `NonBeltramiCoherentTubeCannotPersist`
  as the highest-value remaining NS hard gate.  NS physical bridge, actual
  `R+` decay, Gate3 Mosco/no-pollution, YM nonperturbative
  uniformity/leakage, constructive QFT, Lean-port work, and all promotions
  remain false.  Solved items are not promotion evidence.

- Sprint 32 Beltrami coherence falsification for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyTwoBeltramiCoherenceFalsificationReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyTwoBeltramiCoherenceFalsification.md`, and wired
  the receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 31,
  records the coherent parallel-tube / Beltrami-like adversary, defines the
  Beltrami defect, direction coherence defect, and pressure decorrelation
  score, and refines the ternary branches to pressure-decorrelated,
  Beltrami-safe neutral, and coherent non-Beltrami danger.  Exact Beltrami is
  recorded as neutral, measured pressure decorrelation downgrades danger to
  neutral, and the hard gate is named
  `NonBeltramiCoherentTubeCannotPersist`.  Pressure decorrelation for all
  coherent tubes, `Q_K <= C R_K^+`, actual subcritical decay, Gate3 closure,
  Yang-Mills uniformity, Lean-port work, and all promotion flags remain false.
  The layer is NS-only and external artifacts remain context only, not Agda
  authority or promotion evidence.

- Sprint 31 algebraic micro-closures for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyOneAlgebraicMicroClosureReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyOneAlgebraicMicroClosures.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 30 and
  records closed algebraic/bookkeeping micro-lemmas: trit partition, ternary
  mass conservation, residue bounds, net residue bounds, positive-tail
  summability arithmetic, Gate3 power-law fill-distance limit zero, YM
  correction-budget implication, and pressure trit fail-closed combination
  laws.  It adds the Gate3 `1e-8 -> 29920357` witness and the YM `k=120`
  diagnostic row.  `R_K^+` physical stretching control, actual-NS `R_K^+`
  decay, pressure decorrelation, Gate3 Mosco/no-pollution, YM
  nonperturbative uniformity/leakage, constructive QFT, Lean-port work, and
  all promotion flags remain false.  External artifacts remain context only,
  not Agda authority or promotion evidence.

- Sprint 30 ternary residue refinement for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirtyTernaryResidueRefinementReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintThirtyTernaryResidueRefinement.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 29,
  replaces the binary bad-mask reading as the primary grammar with ternary
  `tau_K in {-1,0,+1}`, records the residue triple
  `(R_K^-, R_K^0, R_K^+)`, keeps `R_K^+` as the Clay-facing scalar, keeps
  `R_K^+ - R_K^-` as the DASHI-facing cancellation scalar, and records
  pressure as a ternary modifier that may downgrade danger only when measured.
  It is a refinement receipt only: simplex bounds, `Q_K <= C R_K^+`, dynamic
  depletion, net residue improvement, pressure decorrelation, Gate3 closure,
  Yang-Mills uniformity, Lean-port work, and all promotion flags remain false.
  External artifacts remain context only, not Agda authority or promotion
  evidence.

- Sprint 29 analytic residue falsification harness for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyNineAnalyticResidueHarnessReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyNineAnalyticResidueHarness.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 28,
  records the concrete non-tautological candidate
  `R_K = B_K / (P_K + epsilon)`, records the physical stretching ratio `Q_K`,
  records the decisive bridge test `Q_K <= C R_K`, records the dynamic ratio
  test below `1 / sqrt(2)`, and records the pressure-decorrelation mask for
  coherent tubes.  It is a falsification harness only: residue boundedness,
  physical stretching control, dynamic decay, pressure decorrelation,
  Beltrami safety, regularity, Gate3 closure, Lean-port work, and all
  promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 28 productive micro-lemma layer for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyEightProductiveMicroLemmaReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyEightProductiveMicroLemmas.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 27,
  records Gate3 power-law fill-distance-to-zero as ledger-level closed, closes
  the NS `r * sqrt(2) < 1` threshold arithmetic, records the productive
  geometric weighted `BraidResidue369` candidate and `Q_K <= C R_K` test, and
  records the YM correction-budget implication as support-only algebra.  It
  includes Gate3 witnesses through `10^-6`, NS one-percent tail cutoffs, and
  YM rho diagnostics through `k = 100`.  All analytic bridges and promotion
  flags remain false.

- Sprint 27 pressure-decorrelation attempt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentySevenPressureDecorrelationReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentySevenPressureDecorrelation.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 26 and
  the single NS conjecture receipt, records CFM direction defect and Beltrami
  defect as non-circular candidate residues, rejects the tautological
  stretching ratio as circular, records pressure-Hessian computation positives,
  names the global parallel-tube adversary, and leaves nonlinear
  vorticity-direction mixing as the exact open gate.  It records viscous
  attenuation as diagnostic only and uploaded/preliminary artifacts as context
  only.  All promotion flags remain false.

- NS analytic braid-residue depletion conjecture for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSAnalyticBraidResidueDepletionConjectureReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/NSAnalyticBraidResidueDepletionConjecture.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes the existing
  split NS residue and Sprint 26 audit surfaces, names
  `AnalyticBraidResidueDepletionForNS` as the single productive conjecture,
  records reference checks, and keeps all Navier-Stokes and Clay promotion
  flags false.

- Sprint 26 closure/falsification test layer for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentySixClosureFalsificationTestReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentySixClosureFalsificationTests.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 25 and
  turns the optimal route into pass/fail tests for Gate3 power-law
  density/Mosco, NS summability plus analytic residue/`Q_K`/dynamic ratio, and
  YM correction/rho/leakage.  It records explicit fail criteria and six
  workers, with all promotion flags remaining false.

- Sprint 25 shortest/optimal path ledger for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyFiveShortestOptimalPathReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyFiveShortestOptimalPath.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 24, NS
  analytic residue, NS dynamic vortex, and YM margin receipts; records Gate3
  as nearest support, NS as shortest Clay-facing, and YM as longer
  constructive-QFT; adds ELI5 lemma surfaces, proposed solution directions,
  rejected alternatives, and six worker lanes.  It remains a decision ledger
  only and all promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 24 micro-lemma layer for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyFourMicroLemmaReceipt.agda`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyFourMicroLemma.md`, and wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 23 and records the
  closeable targets `PrunedFillDistanceGoesToZero`,
  `ResidueDecayBeatsHalfDerivative`, and `NonperturbativeCorrectionBudget`,
  with Gate3 constants, NS threshold products, and YM safe-scale tolerances
  carried forward.  Six workers are assigned and all promotion flags remain
  false.

- Sprint 23 support-threshold / audit layer for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyThreeLeanBridgeAuditReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyThreeLeanBridgeAudit.md`, and wired the receipt
  through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes Sprint 22, records
  threshold theorem targets as support-only rather than Agda authority, adds
  the NS physical bridge audit surface `Q_K <= C * R_K`, and keeps Gate3 at
  power-law-to-density plus Mosco/no-pollution, NS at analytic residue plus
  deterministic depletion, and YM at safe-scale correction/rho/leakage.  Six
  workers are assigned across Gate3, NS, YM, governance, and
  validation.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 22 threshold/falsification audit for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyTwoThresholdFalsificationReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyTwoThresholdFalsification.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records Gate3 pruned
  fill-distance power-law witnesses with `alpha = 0.92` and `C ~= 0.07549`,
  NS braid-residue tail-depth thresholds, the expanded YM correction budget
  against `beta >= 14.16373` with preferred safe scale `k0 >= 67`, and T7A
  quarantine at `beta*_T7A ~= 16.5556`.  Six workers are assigned across
  Gate3, NS, YM, T7A governance, and validation.  All promotion flags remain
  false.

- Sprint 21 frontier audit for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyOneFrontierAuditReceipt.agda`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyOneFrontierAudit.md`, and wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records Gate3 pruned fill-distance
  `alpha = 0.92 > 0` as a support density result, while Mosco/no-pollution
  and mass-shell bridge calibration remain open.  NS remains blocked by
  physical residue control plus deterministic subcritical depletion; YM
  remains blocked by nonperturbative correction/rho/leakage beyond the
  diagnostic safe scale `k0 = 61`.  Six workers are assigned across those
  lanes.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 20 concrete audit for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwentyConcreteAuditReceipt.agda`, added
  `Docs/ClaySprintTwentyConcreteAudit.md`, and wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  It records the Gate3 fill-distance witness table,
  the NS `r * sqrt(2)` regime table, and the YM one-loop correction tolerance
  table.  It sharpens the next targets to
  `PruningPreservesCumulativeFillDistance`,
  `BraidResidueControlsPhysicalStretching`,
  `DynamicBraidResidueDecayForNS` below the critical base, and
  `ContinuumUniformRhoBoundAtSafeScale` with nonperturbative correction and
  leakage control.  Stale `(6/7) * sqrt(2)` docs were corrected to `1.212`.
  All promotion flags remain false.

- Maximal honest Clay push for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayMaximalHonestPushReceipt.agda`, added
  `Docs/ClayMaximalHonestPush.md`, and wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records official Clay status as
  governance context, keeps the NS static Leray/Sobolev route killed, records
  Beltrami cancellation as real but insufficient, keeps the braid-correlation
  theorem conditional, keeps YM `BetaForTargetRho` as closed algebra, and
  assigns six workers to Gate3 Mosco, NS residue/stretch/dynamic decay, YM
  uniformity/correction, and governance.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 19 targeted calculations for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintNineteenTargetedCalculationReceipt.agda`,
  added `Docs/ClaySprintNineteenTargetedCalculations.md`, and wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records the next
  concrete checks: Gate3 pruned fill-distance preservation with
  `h_pruned(J) <= C / J^alpha`, NS dynamic residue decay under the generalized
  threshold `r * sqrt(2) < 1`, and YM nonperturbative correction budget
  against `beta >= 14.1637` / `rho <= 0.90`.  Corrected the BT-carrier product
  in the braid-correlation frontier to `(6/7) * sqrt(2) ~= 1.212`, still
  failing the NS criterion.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 18 shortest-path completion ledger for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayShortestPathCompletionLedgerReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintEighteenCompletionWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`,
  with matching docs, then wired both through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The
  receipt records the shortest current NS route through
  `BraidResidueControlsPhysicalStretching`, `DynamicBraidResidueDecayForNS`,
  and coherent-tube exclusion/Leray enforcement; it records the longer YM
  route through nonperturbative RG monotonicity, uniform rho/leakage,
  Shimura-flat universality, self-adjoint Hamiltonian, mass-gap survival,
  OS/Wightman reconstruction, and nontrivial SU3.  Six Sprint 18 workers are
  assigned across these gates.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Braid-correlation frontier for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayBraidCorrelationFrontierReceipt.agda`, added
  `Docs/ClayBraidCorrelationFrontier.md`, and wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records the conditional criterion
  `BraidResidue369(K) <= C * r^K` with `r * sqrt(2) < 1`; DNS-like
  `(2/3)^K` correlation is sufficient, BT `(6/7)^K` decorrelation is not
  sufficient alone, and coherent vortex tubes remain the NS terminal.  It also
  records the CFM-style direction-regularity reading and names
  `HyperbolicShimuraToEuclideanUniversality` as the shared NS/YM transfer
  blocker.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 17 analytic residue control for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSAnalyticResidueControlReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSeventeenAnalyticResidueWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`,
  with matching docs, then wired both through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The NS
  route is tightened from branch-count decay to the analytic interface
  `BraidResidueControlsPhysicalStretching` plus deterministic
  `DynamicBraidResidueDecayForNS`.  The receipt records five audit questions:
  residue functional, physical stretching control, deterministic `1/3` decay,
  coherent tube adversary, and Leray/supervoxel enforcement.  All promotion
  flags remain false.

- Remote-thread implementation audit for `2026-06-03`: pulled and resolved
  ChatGPT UUID `6a1fe6db-d050-83ec-b6d6-3822402518ce` as `DASHI NS Research
  Update`, canonical thread ID `a3dcc76419b5e8c401fdac5ce541255111c3ab0d`,
  with 64 inserted messages in the canonical archive.  Added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayRemoteThreadImplementationAuditReceipt.agda`,
  added matching docs, and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The
  receipt records the six audited lanes and the sharper thread distinctions:
  Gate3 is structurally close but still typed-flag false, NS conditional
  depletion identities are not dynamic production, and YM still needs
  `YMNonperturbativeRGMonotonicity` plus continuum-uniform rho/leakage and
  constructive QFT.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 16 braid-depletion worker assignment for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSDynamicBraidDepletionReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixteenBraidDepletionWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`,
  with matching docs, then wired both through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The
  NS receipt records the conditional absorption calculation
  `3^-K * 2^(K/2) = (sqrt(2)/3)^K` and keeps
  `DynamicBraidResidueDecayForNS` open.  It also records the guard that
  branch counting alone cannot promote deterministic Navier-Stokes.  Six
  workers are assigned to carrier residue counting, transition decay,
  deterministic promotion, density/stability, Gate3 continuation, and YM
  continuation.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 15 dynamic-vortex worker assignment for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSDynamicVortexStructureReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFifteenDynamicWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`,
  with matching docs, then wired both through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The NS
  receipt records solved vorticity/strain/Beltrami/projection algebra,
  conditional adjacent-angle absorption, pressure-direct-dissipation no-go,
  and the `H118` fallback as non-closing.  The live Clay-critical theorem is
  `DynamicHalfDerivativeDepletion`.  Gate3 and YM continuation workers remain
  assigned; all promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 14 highest-alpha worker receipt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFourteenHighestAlphaWorkerReceipt.agda`,
  with matching docs, then wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The
  receipt consumes Sprint 13 and assigns six workers only to state-changing
  targets: Gate3 Mosco recovery and no-pollution transfer, NS negative theorem
  packaging and actual-flow dynamical structure, and YM continuum-uniform
  `rho <= 0.90` plus leakage.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 13 attempt ledger for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThirteenAttemptLedgerReceipt.agda`, with
  matching docs, then wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt
  consumes Sprint 12 and records the shortest remaining paths: Gate3
  `MoscoRecoveryFromPrunedUnionDensity -> UniformContinuumFrameLowerBound ->
  Gate3MoscoNoPollutionTransfer`, NS actual-flow dynamical structure beyond
  the killed Leray/Sobolev route, and YM continuum-uniform `rho <= 0.90`
  plus leakage before Shimura-flat/constructive QFT terminals.  Six Sprint 13
  workers are assigned; all promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 12 bridge receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3PrunedUnionDensityClosureReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTwelveBridgeWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`,
  with matching docs, then wired them through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3
  now has the exact post-density bridge:
  `MoscoRecoveryFromPrunedUnionDensity -> UniformContinuumFrameLowerBound ->
  Gate3MoscoNoPollutionTransfer`.  NS remains at the killed Leray/Sobolev
  route plus missing dynamic structure.  YM remains at continuum-uniform
  `rho <= 0.90` and leakage.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 11 inventory and worker assignment for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintElevenInventoryReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintElevenWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`, with
  matching docs, then wired both through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The live
  programme is recorded as 14 proved/discharged lemmas, 3 close formalisation
  targets, 5 hard-open lemmas, and 8 downstream Clay-hard terminals.  The five
  hard-open lemmas are `ContinuumUniformRhoBound`,
  `ContinuumUniformLeakageBound`, `HyperbolicShimuraToEuclideanUniversality`,
  `VortexAlignmentDynamical`, and `KStarDriftNonCircular`.  Six Sprint 11
  workers are assigned; all promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 10 highest-alpha receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3PrunedUnionDensityReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSLeraySobolevSharpnessReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMMarginAlgebraClosedUniformityOpenReceipt.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintTenWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`, with
  matching docs, then wired them through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now
  records `OKCosetsDenseInS1`, `CumulativeFillDistanceGoesToZero`, and
  pruned-union angular `L2` density rather than single-level Nyquist; Mosco
  recovery remains open.  NS records the Leray/Sobolev scaling obstruction to
  subcritical vortex-stretching absorption as proved and leaves missing
  dynamics open.  YM records beta/rho margin algebra as closed while
  continuum-uniform rho and leakage remain open.  All promotion flags remain
  false.

- Sprint 8 split receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3PrunedDensityMoscoReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSSubcriticalVortexStretchingReceipt.agda`, and
  wired them through `DASHI/Everything.agda` alongside the existing Sprint 8
  margin and worker receipts.  These split each live lane into closed model
  theorem, failed naive transfer, and exact remaining promotion lemma.  The
  NS Sprint 7 receipt is corrected to the cubic enstrophy surface
  `dE/dt <= C_nu E^3` for `E=||grad u||_2^2`.  All promotion flags remain
  false.

- Sprint 8 sharpening receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3DepthDecoupledFrameReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSLadyzhenskayaCubicObstructionReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMMarginParametricBalabanReceipt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintEightWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`, with
  matching docs, then wired them through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now
  records depth coupling as the precise Archimedean collapse source and
  leaves `MoscoDensityFromBoundedCovering` as the live support blocker.  NS
  corrects the live enstrophy obstruction to cubic `E^3`, with
  `SubcriticalVortexStretchingAbsorption` still open.  YM records
  margin-parametric Balaban targets: bare seed `rho ~= 0.987`, usable
  `rho <= 0.90` at `beta ~= 14.1637`, and strong `rho <= 0.75` at
  `beta ~= 15.0845`.  Six Sprint 8 workers are assigned; all promotion flags
  remain false.

- Sprint 7 attack-result receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PrunedSSPSpectralTransferReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSLadyzhenskayaEnstrophyObstructionReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMOneLoopBalaban1to3Receipt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSevenAttackResultReceipt.agda`, with
  matching docs, then wired them through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now
  records a finite pruned frame with `55/120` atoms retained,
  `A_N >= 0.010` for `N <= 55`, all six levels represented, and weighted
  embedding failure because the collapse is angular; the remaining blocker is
  admissible density.  NS records that the direct enstrophy attack recovers the
  Ladyzhenskaya/Prodi/Serrin obstruction and exposes the missing `L4_t L4_x`
  input.  YM records that one-loop scale selection, post-seed contraction, and
  leakage summability pass, while nonperturbative continuum uniformity remains
  open.  All promotion flags remain false.

- Sprint 6 transfer correction receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3SpectralTransferOrPruningReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSEnstrophyClayHingeReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMConstructiveQFTFlagRouteReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixTransferWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda`,
  and matching docs, then wired the receipts through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
  The live Gate3 blocker is corrected from MirrorB/carrier equivalence alone
  to `SSPIsometricEmbeddingOrSpectralTransfer`: the p-adic frame can be tight
  while the Archimedean continuum Gram collapses.  The receipt records pruned
  and weighted spectral transfer as the two live branches.  NS is reframed at
  the `VortexStretchingAbsorption` / pointwise-enstrophy hinge, and YM is
  reframed as `YMBalabanContinuumLimit` plus the constructive QFT terminal
  stack.  Six workers are assigned.  All Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, and terminal promotions remain false.

- Sprint 6 flag-flip target receipt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintSixFlagFlipReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClaySprintSixFlagFlip.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes the Sprint 5 Gate3
  frame-carrier, NS commutator-equivalence, and YM Balaban-continuum receipts
  and records the corrected flag-flip order: Gate3 first via
  `MirrorBNonDegenerate2D` plus `SSPFrameCarrierEqualsOKTensorZ3`, NS second
  via `PointwiseEnstrophyControl` /
  `CommutatorLipschitzControlWithoutRegularity` as a Clay-equivalent route,
  and YM third via `YMBalabanContinuumLimit` plus Shimura-flat, Hamiltonian,
  continuum mass-gap, OS/Wightman, and nontrivial SU3 closures.  Six workers
  are assigned to those targets.  All Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, and terminal promotions remain false.

- Sprint 5 correction receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3FrameCarrierEquivalenceReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMBalabanContinuumLimitReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSCommutatorEquivalenceReceipt.agda`, and matching
  docs, then wired them through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now records
  five explicit `SSPFrameCarrierEqualsOKTensorZ3` fields, the pending MirrorB
  `notDegenerate1D` check, `sigma_frame=0.145230`, and
  `S_3D(sigma_frame)=0.000017`, while keeping Gate3 false.  YM retracts the
  finite-induction interpretation of the 43-step diagnostic and replaces it
  with the uniform `YMBalabanContinuumLimit` target; `q(beta=6)=4.53>1` is
  recorded as the reason induction cannot start at the physical coupling.  NS
  records the commutator Lipschitz obstruction as equivalent to blowup
  prevention and keeps the `K^(-1/2)` claim retracted.  No Clay, Gate3, YM,
  NS, W4, gravity, Schwarzschild, or terminal promotion was introduced.
- The same Sprint 5 tranche added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiveSixWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClaySprintFiveSixWorkerAssignment.md`, assigning W1/W2 to Gate3,
  W3/W4 to YM, W5 to NS, and W6 to governance.  This records ownership only;
  `hardBridgeCompletedHere=false`.

- Sprint 4 promotion flag-flip lemma priorities for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayPromotionFlagFlipLemmaReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayPromotionFlagFlipLemmas.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes the Sprint 3 shortest-path
  surface and filters it to lemmas that can actually flip flags: Gate3 needs
  `SSPFrameCarrierEqualsOKTensorZ3`, `UniformFrameLowerBound`, and
  `Gate3MoscoNoPollutionTransfer`; Navier-Stokes needs
  `CommutatorLipschitzControlWithoutRegularity`; Yang-Mills needs 43-step
  Balaban control, Shimura-flat transfer, OS/Wightman, mass-gap survival, and
  nontrivial SU3.  Six workers are assigned to those flag-critical targets.
  The receipt records that numeric/model/finite receipts do not promote Clay,
  and all Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity, Schwarzschild, and terminal
  promotions remain false.

- Sprint 3 shortest-path implementation receipt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThreeShortestPathReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClaySprintThreeShortestPath.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt consumes the Sprint 3 work-order,
  Gate3 `O_K`, NS commutator-obstruction, and YM 43-step target receipts to
  record the current shortest path: Gate3 support first needs
  `SSPCarrierEqualsOKHeckeModel`; NS first needs
  `CommutatorLipschitzControlWithoutRegularity`; YM first needs
  `YMFortyThreeStepBalabanUniformity` plus leakage summability.  The six
  workers are assigned to concrete best-effort attempts, and
  `hardBridgeCompletedHere=false`; no Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Sprint 3 sharpened target receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicalSSPOKHeckeModelClosureReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSHighLowCommutatorObstructionReceipt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMFortyThreeStepBalabanTargetReceipt.agda`, plus
  matching docs, then wired all three through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
  Gate3 now has a dedicated model-side closure surface with
  `S_3D(sigma_OK)=0.190298810<1` while leaving
  `SSPCarrierEqualsOKHeckeModel` open.  NS now has a dedicated
  commutator-obstruction surface recording transport cancellation, HighLow
  commutator reduction, the `K^(-1/2)` retraction, and
  `CommutatorLipschitzControlWithoutRegularity` as the live blocker.  YM now
  has a dedicated 43-step target surface recording the exact strict seed
  inequality, robust `beta_eff>=13.7`, and `(k : Fin 43) -> rho k < 1`
  target.  No Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity, Schwarzschild, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

- Sprint 3 implementation work orders for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThreeImplementationWorkOrderReceipt.agda`
  and `Docs/ClaySprintThreeImplementationWorkOrders.md`, then wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt converts the
  six-worker assignment into implementation contracts with deliverables,
  acceptance criteria, and kill criteria: W1
  `SSPCarrierEqualsOKHeckeModel`, W2 conditional Gate3 frame/Mosco, W3
  `CommutatorLipschitzControl`, W4 HighLow counterfamily/audit, W5 42--43
  step Balaban uniformity, and W6 governance.  It records
  `allWorkersAssignedToImplementation=true` and
  `hardBridgeCompletedHere=false`; no Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Sprint 3 corrected six-worker assignment for `2026-06-03`: updated
  `PhysicalSSPHeckeModelClosureReceipt`, `NSHighLowFluxControlAuditReceipt`,
  and `YMFortyTwoStepBalabanTargetReceipt`; added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintThreeSixWorkerAssignmentReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClaySprintThreeSixWorkerAssignment.md`; and wired the new receipt
  through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now records the corrected
  `O_K=Z[(1+sqrt(-7))/2]` Hecke/BT model with 118 atoms at norm `<=49`,
  `sigma_OK=0.246770`, and `S_3D(sigma_OK)=0.190000`, while keeping
  `SSPCarrierEqualsOKHeckeModel` open.  NS retracts the HighLow `K^(-1/2)`
  claim, records exact transport cancellation and commutator-only HighLow
  remainder, and names `CommutatorLipschitzControl` as the live obstruction.
  YM records the 42--43 step non-perturbative Balaban target toward the exact
  strict seed inequality / robust sample `beta_eff>=13.7`.  The six workers
  own Gate3 identification, conditional Gate3 frame/Mosco consumption, NS
  commutator Lipschitz, NS counterfamily/audit, YM uniformity, and governance.
  No Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity, Schwarzschild, or terminal promotion
  was introduced.

- Three-worker implementation assignment for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayThreeWorkerImplementationAssignmentReceipt.agda`
  and `Docs/ClayThreeWorkerImplementationAssignment.md`, then wired the
  receipt through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt assigns one worker to
  each then-live bridge: W1 Gate3 owns `SSPCarrierEqualsHeckeModel`, W2 NS
  owns the HighLow flux audit/counterfamily, and W3 YM owns the 42-step
  Balaban target toward `beta_eff>=13.7`.  This records ownership only and
  does not prove any bridge or promote Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, or terminal claims.

- Second worker iteration for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicalSSPHeckeModelClosureReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSHighLowFluxControlAuditReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMFortyTwoStepBalabanTargetReceipt.agda`, and their
  docs, then wired the receipts through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now
  recorded earlier cruder Hecke/BT model values, now superseded by the
  corrected `O_K` model in the Sprint 3 entry above.  NS now audits the HighLow
  `K^(-1/2)` suppression claim and keeps it rejected until derivative
  placement, frequency gain, and no-hidden-regularity checks are inhabited.
  YM now records the 42-step non-perturbative Balaban target toward the exact
  strict seed inequality / robust sample `beta_eff>=13.7`.  No Clay, Gate3,
  YM, NS, W4, gravity, Schwarzschild, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Clay KP corrected series identity for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayKPCorrectedSeriesIdentityReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayKPCorrectedSeriesIdentity.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records the corrected
  connected-animal formula `sum d*p^(d-1)*q^d = q/(1-p*q)^2`, rejects the
  legacy `p*q/(1-p*q)^2` expression for this route, consumes the
  `9.593637` precision ledger, and keeps the consequence limited to KP
  convergence bookkeeping.  It does not formalise the analytic
  infinite-series theorem in Agda and does not prove strict Balaban seed,
  Balaban transfer, or Clay YM.

- Clay numeric precision correction for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayNumericPrecisionCorrectionReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayNumericPrecisionCorrection.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The receipt records the sharper computed values:
  connected-animal KP threshold `9.593637` with gap `3.593637`, BT-tree
  threshold `10.13086` with gap `4.13086`, strict Balaban seed threshold
  `13.631603` with gap `7.631603`, and the one-density Gate3 PAWOTG values
  `S_3(sigma_digit)=0.080284628`, `S_3(0.302511)=0.110976368`,
  `sigma_crit=0.505208`.  It records `13.64` as barely safe under the
  `c_min=0.198` strict convention and keeps the physical 3D SSP/Hecke
  embedding, Balaban transfer, NS dominance, Gate3 closure, and Clay
  promotions open.
- The same precision pass corrected the live BT-tree coarse ledger in
  `ClaySolvedLedgerLemmas`, `ClayOptimalKernelLemmaReceipt`, and
  `YMBalabanMarginSplitReceipt` from `10.11`/gap `4.11` to `10.13`/gap
  `4.13`.  Connected-animal convergence is now guarded by higher-precision
  `9.593637` language, and strict Balaban seed statements are routed to the
  exact inequality `beta*c_min-a>log(2p)` or a robust numeric sample such as
  `beta_eff>=13.7`.

- Clay solved ledger lemmas for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySolvedLedgerLemmas.agda` and
  `Docs/ClaySolvedLedgerLemmas.md`, then wired the module through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The new module inhabits only threshold constants,
  gap arithmetic, route classifications, T7A demotion, live-target names, and
  false promotion flags.  It explicitly does not inhabit Balaban transfer,
  Shimura-to-Euclidean universality, OS/Wightman reconstruction, mass-gap
  survival, nontrivial SU3 YM, NS cumulative tail dominance, NS projection
  transport/defect absorption, physical SSP spread, or uniform frame lower
  bound.

- Next execution receipts for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicalSSPSpreadBoundAttemptReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSCumulativeTailDominanceObstructionReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMBalabanMarginSplitReceipt.agda`, and their docs,
  then wired the receipts through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  Gate3 now has a
  concrete physical SSP spread attempt with first missing coordinate map, plus
  BT-metric model closure (`A_infty=1`, `mu_N=0`,
  `S_1D(p=3,sigma=0.289)=0.080940589`, and
  `S_3D(p=3,sigma_digit)=0.722893945`); NS now has the cumulative tail
  dominance obstruction split with HighHigh recorded as the absorptive partial
  result and `HighLowFluxControlWithoutRegularity` as the live lemma; YM now
  records `9.593637` as KP convergence only and
  `beta*c_min-a>log(2p)` / robust sample `13.7` as the strict Balaban seed.  No
  Clay, Gate3, W4, gravity, Schwarzschild, YM, NS, or terminal promotion was
  introduced.

- Clay own-brain completion receipt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayOwnBrainCompletionReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayOwnBrainCompletion.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  This records the work that can be completed from
  repo-internal reasoning alone: the connected-animal formula correction,
  four-gap ledger separation, T7A direct-counting demotion, 30-lemma kernel
  freeze, six-worker kill criteria, and promotion guard audit.  It records
  the remaining external blockers as Balaban transfer, Shimura-to-Euclidean
  universality, OS/Wightman/mass-gap/nontriviality, NS cumulative tail
  dominance, projection-defect absorption, all-smooth-data stability, and
  Gate3 physical SSP spread/frame bounds.  No Clay, Gate3, YM, NS, W4,
  gravity, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Clay requisite kernel lemma receipt for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayRequisiteKernelLemmaReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayRequisiteKernelLemmas.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  This narrow receipt records the current minimal
  Clay-requisite lemma surface: YM connected-animal KP plus optional T7A
  per-polymer suppression, Balaban/RG, Shimura-to-flat universality,
  OS/Wightman and uniform mass-gap survival; NS projection transport,
  cumulative tail dissipation dominance, danger shell, `K*`, continuation,
  and approximation stability; Gate3 physical SSP spread, frame lower bound,
  and Mosco/no-pollution support.  It records the updated proved inputs
  (`T7A(d)>0`, `count(d)<=d*p^(d-1)`, connected-animal `beta* ~= 9.59`,
  direct `T7A beta* ~= 16.56`, numerical shell-flux identity, synthetic
  dissipation dominance) while keeping all Clay, Gate3, W4, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, YM, NS, and terminal promotions false.

- Clay proof campaign dependency DAG for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayProofCampaignDependencyDAGReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayProofCampaignDependencyDAG.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The DAG records the expanded six-worker proof
  campaign: YM activity, YM Balaban/continuum, YM OS/local geometry, NS Path
  A/B, Gate3/W4/GR, and governance guardrails. It locks the Gate3 CM
  arithmetic correction: literal `Q(sqrt(-7))` splitting over SSP primes is
  `5+9+1`, semantic atom/frame grammar remains `7+7+1`, and `p71` is
  split-not-inert. No Clay, Gate3, gravity, W4, Schwarzschild, YM, NS, AQFT,
  empirical, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Clay optimal kernel lemma map for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayOptimalKernelLemmaReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayOptimalKernelLemmas.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The map records the corrected 12 YM + 13 NS + 5
  Gate3 support
  kernels and assigns six worker lanes.  The YM ledger keeps distinct
  thresholds visible: connected-animal `beta* ~= 9.593637`, p=7 BT-tree
  `beta* ~= 10.13` with gap `4.13`, strict seed inequality
  `beta*c_min-a>log(2p)` with robust sample `13.7`, and direct T7A
  `beta* ~= 16.56`.  T7A direct counting remains demoted and may only re-enter
  as per-polymer activity suppression.  The connected-animal closed form is
  now recorded as `q/(1-p*q)^2`, not `p*q/(1-p*q)^2`; the `9.59` threshold is
  unchanged.  No Clay, Gate3, W4, gravity, YM, NS, Schwarzschild, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

- Clay optimal path requisite lemmas for `2026-06-03`: added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayOptimalPathRequisiteLemmaReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayOptimalPathRequisiteLemmas.md`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The new receipt consumes the current kernel,
  hard-lemma, direct-T7A, NS obstruction, and gravity receipts, ranks the work
  order as Yang-Mills first, Navier-Stokes split second, and Gate3/W4/gravity
  third, and assigns six worker lanes.  It preserves the kernel correction:
  connected-animal counting is the standard computable YM KP route
  (`beta* ~= 9.59`), while T7A per-polymer activity suppression remains the
  improvement theorem target.  All listed lemmas are recorded as
  constructorless `MissingTheoremTarget` surfaces; no Clay, Gate3, gravity,
  W4, Schwarzschild, YM, NS, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Corrected Clay kernel reduction for `2026-06-03`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayKernelReductionReceipt.agda`, with
  `Docs/ClayKernelReduction.md`.  The update answers what DASHI currently
  buys for Clay: precise fault localisation into three hard kernels, not a
  proof.  YM is corrected by the CSV audit: direct `T7A` KP is proved at
  `beta* ~= 16.56` but is worse than connected-animal counting, so the
  standard computable route is connected-animal `beta* ~= 9.59` with Balaban
  gap `3.59`; T7A can help only through the open per-polymer
  activity-suppression lemma.
  NS is compressed to `DangerShellMaximumPrinciple` as the non-circular hard
  lemma, and Gate3 is compressed to physical 3D frame-symbol positivity while
  preserving the guard that `7+7+1` is atom/frame grammar, not the literal
  `Q(sqrt(-7))` split table.  The receipt also records the shared
  scale-pressure abstraction and six worker kill-tests.  No Clay, YM, NS,
  Gate3, gravity, W4, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Direct T7A KP / Clay-path correction for `2026-06-03`: updated
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMT7RademacherActivityIdentificationReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayHardLemmaReductionReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayContinuumMathTransitionReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3PhaseCompletenessReductionReceipt.agda`, and
  the corresponding docs.  The live standard YM KP object is now
  connected-animal counting, with computed threshold `beta* ~= 9.59` and gap
  `3.59` from physical `beta ~= 6`; direct `T7A` is computed at
  `beta* ~= 16.56` but is worse as counting, while `C0 = 2` is heuristic
  only.
  Gate3 now records that 1D position-orthogonal toy Grams cannot witness the
  phase failure mode, so the phase-completeness proof target lives in the
  physical 3D Archimedean overlap model.  NS remains split into Path A
  obstruction and Path B `H^{11/8}` / `K*`.  No Clay, Gate3, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, W4, YM, NS, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Clay hard-lemma reduction for `2026-06-03`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3PhaseCompletenessReductionReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayHardLemmaReductionReceipt.agda`, with docs in
  `Docs/Gate3PhaseCompletenessReduction.md` and
  `Docs/ClayHardLemmaReduction.md`.  The update records the corrected solve
  strategy: YM uses connected-animal KP counting with threshold
  `beta* ~= 9.59` before the Balaban bridge, while T7A per-polymer activity
  suppression remains open; Gate3 needs phase-complete frame factors
  `A_split`, `A_inert`, `A_71` plus uniform cutoff lift in the 3D
  embedding; gravity needs the physical SSP spread inequality
  `sigma_physical_SSP < 0.3025113508228815`; NS keeps Path A as an
  obstruction paper and Path B as the non-circular `H^{11/8}` / `K*` route.
  `ClayContinuumMathTransitionReceipt` now states that the live YM beta gap is
  `3.59`.  No Clay, Gate3, gravity,
  Schwarzschild, W4, YM, NS, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- YM T7 Rademacher activity audit for `2026-06-03`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MonsterOggPrimeCorrectionReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMT7RademacherActivityIdentificationReceipt.agda`,
  with docs in `Docs/MonsterOggPrimeCorrection.md` and
  `Docs/YMT7RademacherActivityAudit.md`.  The update corrects the Monster/Ogg
  indexing: `194` Monster McKay-Thompson lanes and `15` Ogg/supersingular
  prime carrier lanes are distinct, so `15 + 179` is quotient bookkeeping, not
  a genus partition.  It records the depth `1..3` T7A/j ratio audit and the
  corrected entropy regimes: raw Monster `C0 ~= 287000`, T7 envelope
  `C0 ~= 115.543`, old `C0 = 2` heuristic, the direct `T7A` KP threshold
  `beta* ~= 16.56`, and the connected-animal threshold `beta* ~= 9.59`.
  No Yang-Mills, Balaban, OS/Wightman, Gate3,
  Clay, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Experimental pressure frontier for `2026-06-03`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExperimentalPressureFrontierReceipt.agda` with
  `Docs/ExperimentalPressureFrontier.md`.  The receipt records `Xi_cc+` as
  QCD binding pressure only, one-dimensional anyons as a Gate3/MirrorB7
  exchange-phase analogy only, and the Monster/T7 depth-3 suppression through
  the corrected Rademacher/direct activity audit: direct `T7A` KP threshold
  `beta* ~= 16.56`, connected-animal threshold `beta* ~= 9.59`, and
  `C0 = 2` heuristic only.  No
  Yang-Mills, Navier-Stokes, gravity, Schwarzschild, Gate3, W4, SSP 3D, or
  terminal promotion was introduced.

- Mixed particle claim-packet governance for `2026-06-03`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MixedParticleClaimPacketReceipt.agda` and documented
  the split in `Docs/MixedParticleClaimPacket.md`.  The receipt separates the
  2026 CERN/LHCb `Xi_cc+` baryon claim from the 2022 LHCb exotic-hadron
  cluster and from the 2026 OIST/University of Oklahoma one-dimensional anyon
  theory lane.  LHCb hadrons are recorded as QCD binding/spectroscopy
  receipts; anyons are recorded as low-dimensional exchange-statistics
  receipts.  New-force, Standard-Model-rewrite, hadron-to-elementary,
  LHC-anyon, and terminal promotions remain false.

- Monster irrep carrier decomposition for `2026-06-03`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MonsterIrrepCarrierDecompositionReceipt.agda`.  It
  records the Monster `194` irreps/conjugacy classes, the `15 + 179` carrier
  quotient bookkeeping, T7 order-7 compression, `204 = 1 + 203`, and the
  Rademacher growth comparison `c7(d) ~ exp(4*pi*sqrt(d)/sqrt(7))` versus raw
  `j` growth.  The receipt keeps correction guards active: the `15` SSP primes
  are Ogg/supersingular prime support, not the only genus-zero
  McKay-Thompson classes; the `179` remainder is quotient-tail bookkeeping,
  not a genus-positive theorem; and `7+7+1` is semantic atom grammar rather
  than literal `Q(sqrt(-7))` split/inert arithmetic.  YM gets quotient-entropy
  evidence, Gate3 gets phase-completeness motivation, NS gets no PDE closure,
  and all Balaban/Gate3/NS/Clay/terminal promotions remain false.

- Analytic sprint capstone coordination for `2026-06-03`: assigned parallel
  worker lanes without changing theorem status.  `W-G3` owns the physical
  SSP/Hecke 3D taper target `sigma_SSP < 0.3025113508228815`; `W-Frame` owns
  `A_split`, `A_inert`, `A_71`, and uniform cutoff lift; `W-YM` owns the
  Balaban `beta ~= 6 -> beta_eff > 15.84` bridge plus OS/Wightman; `W-NS-A`
  owns the `H^{-1/2}` obstruction publication; `W-NS-B` owns the
  non-circular `H^{11/8}` Bernoulli-band and `K*` drift route.  The update
  keeps the checked CM arithmetic correction intact: `7+7+1` is atom/frame
  grammar, while `Q(sqrt(-7))` over the SSP set is `5+9+1` with `p71`
  split-not-inert.  No Clay, Gate 3, gravity, YM, NS, W4, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

- Programme frontier final update for `2026-06-02`: updated
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ProgrammeFrontierUpdateFinalReceipt.agda` to consume
  the newer lane receipts directly.  NS now records the prime-scale Bernstein
  constant as supplied by `NSBernsteinConstantExplicitReceipt` (`C0=sqrt(p)`);
  the live NS gap is the small-viscosity `H^{11/8}` Bernoulli-band and
  all-data extension.  YM now consumes the IR/cusp equivalence surfaces and
  keeps the flat 4D mass-gap/Balaban/OS-Wightman package open.  CKM now
  consumes the alpha/beta carrier receipts and keeps the higher-order
  Vub/beta unitarity correction open.  Clay, terminal, and physical CKM
  promotion remain false.

- Clay continuum mathematics transition for `2026-06-02`: updated
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayContinuumMathTransitionReceipt.agda` and
  `Docs/ClayContinuumMathTransition.md` to record the honest post-grammar
  state.  Gate3/gravity now reduces to the physical SSP/Hecke 3D taper
  calculation `sigma_SSP < 0.3025113508228815`; the digit baseline
  `sigma ~= 0.2886751345948129` passes with series `0.7228939450291813 < 1`.  YM now
  records the T7-compressed Balaban target `beta ~= 6 -> beta_eff > 15.84`,
  gap about `9.84`, plus OS/Wightman transfer.  NS now records Path A as the
  publishable `H^-1/2` obstruction theorem and Path B as the `H^{11/8}`
  Bernoulli-band plus all-data density route for Clay.  No PAWOTG theorem,
  Balaban bridge, OS/Wightman theorem, NS regularity theorem, or Clay
  promotion was introduced.
  The transition now also consumes `SSP7Plus7Plus1AtomGrammarReceipt`
  directly: `15SSP = 7 Hecke + 7 mirror-Hecke + p71 sign`, each septet is
  `7 = 3D + 3D + sign`, and each digit/lane contains depth-many nested 15SSP
  blocks.  This records the symmetry-complexity series that feeds the
  `p^(3d)` Archimedean density calculation without adding any promotion.

- Gravity Vladimirov 3D frame correction for `2026-06-02`: updated the GR
  Vladimirov receipts and docs to record that `D^alpha` eigenvalue weights
  cancel in normalized nesting cross-terms, and that macroscopic gravity
  requires an `L2(R^3)` image with depth density `p^(3d)`, not `p^d`.  This
  makes gravity the binding Archimedean taper condition:
  `sigma_crit_3D(p=3) ~= 0.3025113508228815`,
  `sigma_digit ~= 0.2886751345948129`, and
  `S_3D,p3(sigma_digit) ~= 0.7228939450291813`.  The digit baseline passes
  with narrow headroom about `0.0138`; proving the physical SSP/Hecke
  embedding satisfies `sigma < 0.3025113508228815` would imply the 1D Gate3 condition.
  W4 physical mass/source calibration remains independent; no Schwarzschild,
  Einstein, precision-gravity, Gate3, Clay, W4, or terminal promotion was
  introduced.

- Binary-to-tetralemma margin governance for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BinaryTetralemmaMarginStateReceipt.agda`, and linked
  it into `ClayFinalAnalyticFrontierMapReceipt`.  The final promotion barrier
  remains binary and fail-closed (`P+I<A` / `theta+epsilon<1`), but diagnostics
  are now four-valued: true/absorbed, false/leaking, both/mixed, and
  neither/wrong-seam.  This records the sprint pattern without licensing
  PAWOTG, quotient control, Balaban bridge, NS regularity, Gate 3 closure,
  Clay, or terminal promotion.

- Gate3 taper / NS `H^-1/2` obstruction update for `2026-06-02`: tightened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3NestingTaperConditionReceipt.agda` with
  `sigma_taper(p=3)=0.318022`, `sigma_digit=0.2886751345948129`, and
  `S_p3(sigma_digit)~=0.0803`.  The digit-expansion embedding now sits below
  the strict taper and the PAWOTG series threshold with headroom; the actual
  SSP/Hecke embedding taper theorem remains open.  Added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSHminus1Over2ObstructionReceipt.agda`, recording the
  computed negative-Sobolev defect ratios
  `1.38/2.30/1.67`, `3.99/7.19/7.42`, and `19.85/35.97/38.98` across
  `nu=0.10`, `0.01`, and `0.002`, plus divergence as `nu -> 0` with exponent
  range about `0.5--0.75`.  The NS result is an obstruction witness and
  publication target only; no uniform absorption estimate, NS regularity, Gate
  3 closure, Clay, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Gate3 nesting/taper and YM `T_7` quotient evidence for `2026-06-02`: added
  and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3NestingTaperConditionReceipt.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMMonsterQuotientEvidenceReceipt.agda`.  Gate 3 now
  records the corrected finding that Kozyrev wavelets have identity Gram in
  `L2(Q_p)` and that the finite-frame failure is Archimedean nesting after
  digit expansion; PAWOTG is the Gaussian taper condition that damps this
  nesting.  YM now records McKay-Thompson `T_7` compression of raw Monster
  `c2=21493760` to `204`, about `105000x`.  The older `C0_eff~=2` reading is
  now superseded by the 2026-06-03 Rademacher activity audit: T7 envelope
  `C0~=115.543`, with `C0=2` requiring a separate activity-identification
  lemma.  Both receipts are evidence/reduction surfaces only; no PAWOTG
  theorem, quotient theorem, YM mass gap, Gate 3 closure, Clay, or terminal
  promotion was made.

- Clay final analytic frontier map for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayFinalAnalyticFrontierMapReceipt.agda`.  This is
  now the checked citation point for "what remains for Clay?" after the shared
  scale-graph algebra.  It records the solved algebraic component and links
  the existing Agda surfaces for Monster multiplicity quotient control, Gate 3
  PAWOTG/Mosco/no-spectral-pollution transfer, YM effective-`C0` KP plus
  Balaban physical beta bridge plus OS/Wightman continuum transfer, and NS
  tail-restricted theta plus non-circular high-high/`K*` danger-shell control.
  The receipt is fail-closed: no PAWOTG theorem, quotient theorem, Balaban
  bridge, continuum mass gap, NS danger-shell theorem, Clay claim, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

- Gate 3 atom sampler PAWOTG quality obstruction for `2026-06-02`: added and
  wired `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3AtomSamplerPAWOTGQualityReceipt.agda`.
  The receipt records the current sampler failure: `mu_N ~= 0.93--1.00`,
  `(N-1)mu_N >> 1`, Gershgorin lower bounds always negative, numerical
  `A_N=0`, and max frame ratio about `2.73e16`; phase-complete beats
  phase-blind at `N=8` but both collapse at larger `N`.  The replacement target
  is `AtomSamplerPAWOTGQuality`, i.e. `mu_N <= C/N` or at least
  `(N-1)mu_N < 1`.  The digit-expansion PAWOTG partial result remains valid;
  the current atom sampler is not good enough.  Monster leakage would tighten
  the `p=3` sigma threshold from `0.5052` to about `0.296`/`0.228`.  No PAWOTG
  theorem, Gate 3 closure, quotient theorem, Clay, or terminal promotion was
  made.

- YM C0 entropy threshold sensitivity for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMC0EntropyThresholdSensitivityReceipt.agda`.  The
  receipt records `beta_abs(C0) = (a + log(2 p C0)) / c_min` with `p=7`,
  `a=0.5`, and `c_min=0.242`, the table
  `C0=0.5/1/2/5 -> beta_abs=10.107/12.971/15.836/19.622`, and Monster re-2
  stress `c1=196884`, `c2=21493760`, `c2/c1 ~= 109.17`,
  `sqrt(c2/c1) ~= 10.45`.  Raw Monster multiplicity remains quotiented-only,
  not physical YM polymer entropy; quotient control, YM mass gap, and Clay
  promotion remain false.

- Monster/moonshine SSP quotient control for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MonsterMoonshineSSPQuotientControlReceipt.agda` and
  updated the docs lane to record `MonsterMoonshineSSPQuotientControl` above
  YM/Gate3.  The 15SSP/moonshine mechanism is a quotient/compression target,
  not an entropy multiplier; raw `c2/c1 ~= 109` is not the physical polymer
  entropy constant `C0`.  If quotient control holds, the effective value
  remains `C0_eff ~= 1` and `beta_abs ~= 12.97`; square-root/raw leakage would
  raise thresholds to about `22.66`/`32.35`.  The Monster re-2 artifacts
  `ym_monster_re2_C0_thresholds.csv`,
  `gate3_monster_re2_sigma_crit.csv`,
  `ns_monster_re2_low_shell_vs_tail_summary.csv`, and
  `monster_re2_recalculation_summary.txt` are now copied into the analytic
  evidence bundle.  Gate 3 binding `p=3` `sigma_crit` tightens from `0.505208`
  to `0.337460`, about `0.296`, or about `0.228` under the same stress models.
  The quotient theorem remains open; no PAWOTG theorem, YM mass gap, Clay, or
  terminal promotion was made.

- Computed lemma update for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3DigitExpansionPAWOTGPartialResultReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMCharacterExpansionContinuumReformulationReceipt.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSThetaPressureMarginCorrectionReceipt.agda`.
  Gate 3 records the digit-expansion PAWOTG partial result
  `Var=1/12`, `sigma=1/sqrt(12) ~= 0.2887 < 0.5052` for every prime and BT
  level, while keeping the SSP/CM embedding gap open.  YM records the
  fixed-lattice character-expansion mass bound with anchors
  `m_latt(6) >= 0.183` and `m_latt(12.97) >= 0.080`, reformulating the Clay
  blocker as continuum survival rather than fixed-lattice positivity.  NS
  retracts the stale `H^{11/8}`-weaker-than-`H^{1/2}` comparison and records
  theta as conditional tail-localized pressure-margin decay only.  No Gate 3
  closure, YM mass gap, NS regularity, Clay, or terminal promotion was made.

- Refined Clay diagnostics for `2026-06-02`: added
  `scripts/clay_refined_diagnostics.py`, generated
  `ns_theta_tail_restricted.csv`, `ym_c0_threshold_sensitivity.csv`, and
  `gate3_sampler_quality.csv`, and added/wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayRefinedDiagnosticTargetsReceipt.agda`.  The NS
  diagnostic separates `Theta_global` from `Theta_tail`: sampled global danger
  is low-shell `k=2`, while tail-restricted theta passes for smooth and
  Kolmogorov rows and fails for near-critical and rough rows.  The YM
  diagnostic records `beta_abs(C0) = (a + log(2 p C0)) / c_min`, making entropy
  `C0` load-bearing; the uploaded compact table adds `C0=0.5` and `C0=0.75`
  absorption thresholds.  The Gate 3 diagnostic records zero
  Gershgorin-passing sampler rows and names
  `AtomSamplerPAWOTGQuality : mu_N <= C/N` as the next engineering target.
  Copied the uploaded compact summaries
  `computed_margin_summary.txt`, `gate3_frame_sampler_quality.csv`,
  `ym_beta_threshold_sensitivity_C0.csv`, and
  `ns_global_vs_tail_theta_summary.csv` into the evidence bundle.  No PAWOTG
  theorem, Balaban bridge, NS danger-shell theorem, Gate 3 closure, YM mass
  gap, NS regularity, Clay, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- NS tail-restricted theta receipt for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSTailRestrictedThetaDiagnosticReceipt.agda`.  It
  records low-shell global dominance at `k=2`, requires `Theta_tail` plus
  `low_shell_warning`, records smooth/kolmogorov pass rows, near-critical/rough
  fail rows, and the inviscid no-tail-data boundary.  No theta preservation,
  BKM/Serrin continuation, NS regularity, or Clay promotion is made.

- Clay computed visualisation synthesis for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayComputedVisualizationSynthesisReceipt.agda`.  The
  receipt records the four-visualisation reading as a checked, fail-closed
  ledger.  The receipt now consumes the locked chart constants: Chart 1 makes
  gravity 3D `p=3` the binding PAWOTG hierarchy constraint with
  `sigma_crit = 0.3025113508228815`, `sigma_digit = 0.2886751345948129`, and
  `S_3D,p3 = 0.7228939450291813 < 1`; Chart 2 records YM `beta=6` divergent
  with `r = 2.7017782` and the T7-compressed Balaban gulf toward
  `beta_eff > 15.84`; Chart 3 records the NS `H^-1/2` defect divergence as
  Path A obstruction evidence and the `H^{11/8}` Bernoulli-band route as
  Path B; Chart 4 records Gate3 phase completeness, MirrorA + MirrorB7 + sign,
  as structurally required.  No PAWOTG theorem, Balaban bridge, NS
  danger-shell bound, Gate 3 closure, YM mass gap, NS regularity, Clay, or
  terminal promotion was introduced.

- YM Balaban physical beta bridge target for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMBalabanPhysicalBetaBridgeTargetReceipt.agda`.  The
  receipt consumes the quantitative beta-gap, physical bridge-open, Paper 3,
  KP threshold, actual p=7 Wilson activity, same-prime KP, and Balaban carrier
  RG receipts, and records the exact next theorem target: physical beta
  `~= 6` -> nonperturbative block-spin/RG flow -> KP-safe carrier beta
  `> 12.97` -> strict activity absorption -> carrier area-law connection to
  the physical lane.  It keeps the quantified gaps `4.11` and `6.97`, the
  naive perturbative scale `exp(150) ~= 10^65`,
  `perturbativeBridgeSuffices=false`, `nonperturbativeInputRequired=true`, and
  all YM/Clay/terminal promotion flags false.

- NS lane target receipt for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSNonCircularKStarDriftBoundTargetReceipt.agda`.
  The receipt records the exact post-obstruction theorem target:
  `Flux_{>K*(t)} <= (1-c) Diss_{>K*(t)}` at the danger shell, equivalently
  strict theta preservation, without assuming `H^{1/2}`, Serrin, BKM, or
  stronger regularity.  It keeps non-circular high-high control,
  `K*(t)<=K*(nu)` drift containment, edge influx, theta preservation, and
  tail-to-continuation discharge open.  No NS regularity, Clay, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

- Final reduction receipts for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Gate3AdelicLocalizationReductionReceipt.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YMBetaBridgeQuantitativeGapReceipt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/NSNonCircularObstructionReceipt.agda`.  The Gate 3
  receipt reduces `PAWOTGUniformSeparation` to an explicit adelic embedding
  with uniform Archimedean spread below `sigma_crit(p=3)=0.5052`; the YM
  receipt quantifies the physical beta bridge as nonperturbative, with strict
  gap `6.97` and naive perturbative scale `exp(150) ~= 10^65`; the NS receipt
  records the high-high paraproduct circularity obstruction for
  `NonCircularKStarDriftBound`.  No PAWOTG theorem, RG bridge, NS maximum
  principle, Gate 3 closure, YM mass gap, NS regularity, Clay claim, or
  terminal claim was introduced.

- Clay blocker asymmetry ledger for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClayBlockerAsymmetryReceipt.agda`, then linked it from
  `README.md`, `Docs/ClayPrizeLemmaRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/Gate3AdelicSobolevPAWOTGRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/YMPaper3ClayTarget.md`, `Docs/NSPaper1ClayTarget.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `status.md`.  The receipt records that the three final Clay blockers are not
  symmetric: `PAWOTGUniformSeparation` is new adelic-localization mathematics,
  `BalabanPhysicalBetaBridge` is quantitative completion of the Balaban RG
  programme, and `NonCircularKStarDriftBound` is the high-high paraproduct
  obstruction.  NS is now recorded as
  `OpenWithHighHighParaproductObstruction`, not a neutral `OpenUnknown` lemma.
  No PAWOTG theorem, physical beta bridge, NS drift proof, Gate 3 closure, YM
  mass gap, NS regularity, Clay, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Irreducible Clay boundary clarification for `2026-06-02`: updated
  `Docs/ClayPrizeLemmaRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/Gate3AdelicSobolevPAWOTGRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/YMPaper3ClayTarget.md`, `Docs/NSPaper1ClayTarget.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `status.md` to record that the three final inhabitants remain genuinely open
  analytic theorems.  Gate 3 still needs uniform adelic-to-Archimedean
  localization below `sigma_crit(p=3) = 0.5052`; YM still needs a
  nonperturbative `BalabanPhysicalBetaBridge`; NS still needs the
  non-circular high-high paraproduct / `K*` drift bound.  The sprint therefore
  supplies measured reductions and failure locations, not Clay closure.

- Clay analytic evidence bundle for `2026-06-02`: copied the supplied
  diagnostics from `/home/c/Downloads` into
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/` and added
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/README.md` as the artifact manifest.
  Updated `README.md`, `Docs/ClayPrizeLemmaRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/Gate3AdelicSobolevPAWOTGRoadmap.md`, `Docs/YMPaper3ClayTarget.md`,
  `Docs/NSPaper1ClayTarget.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to cite the bundle and the corresponding checked
  Agda receipts.  The docs now record the literal readings of the supplied
  files: Gate 3 finite toy dictionaries fail the sampled Gershgorin condition
  and collapse at larger `N`; YM beta 6 is divergent with
  `r = 2.7017782`; and the NS full theta sweep includes `Theta > 1` stress
  regimes.  These artifacts sharpen the blockers
  `PAWOTGUniformSeparation`, `BalabanPhysicalBetaBridge`, and
  `NonCircularKStarDriftBound`; they do not promote Gate 3 closure, YM mass
  gap, NS regularity, Clay, or terminal claims.

- Revised analytic sprint governance for `2026-06-02`: updated
  `Docs/ClayPrizeLemmaRoadmap.md`, `Docs/PostCMCorrectionClayPriority.md`,
  `Docs/YMPaper3ClayTarget.md`, `TODO.md`, and `status.md`.  The abstract
  scale-graph barrier algebra is now documented as provable once its
  projection, node-margin, edge-influx, and absorber-dominance hypotheses are
  supplied.  Gate 3 finite `A_N > 0` is pinned to finite separation plus a
  Gershgorin lower bound, while the uniform/refinement blocker is
  `PAWOTGUniformSeparation`.  YM KP is pinned to contour/action suppression
  with entropy `C0` and an all-diameter geometric bound, with
  `BalabanPhysicalBetaBridge` as the physical beta blocker.  NS now records that
  `theta` alone does not imply BKM without `NonCircularKStarDriftBound` plus
  enough tail/Sobolev control.  No Gate 3 closure, YM mass gap, NS regularity,
  or Clay promotion was introduced.

- Analytic constants docs audit for `2026-06-02`: updated the prize-facing docs
  and live planning surfaces with the current constants.  Gate 3 PAWOTG/Mosco
  now records the series-side condition `sigma < 0.505`; YM live planning uses
  `c_min = 0.242`, thresholds `10.11`/`12.97`, divergent `beta6` ratio
  `r = 2.70`, and gaps `4.11`/`6.97`; NS records the non-circular
  `K*(t) <= K*(nu)` drift condition.  This is documentation/governance only:
  no PAWOTG density theorem, YM KP theorem, Balaban transfer, NS maximum
  principle, Gate 3 closure, or Clay promotion was introduced.

- Hecke-vs-CM correction for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `HeckeCarrierVsCMSplittingReceipt` and
  `P71HeckeMirrorSignLaneReceipt`.  The bridge records that CM arithmetic over
  `Q(sqrt(-7))` is `5 split + 9 inert + 1 ramified`, while DASHI/Hecke atom
  grammar is `7+7+1`; these are distinct partitions.  The p71 receipt records
  p71 as split-not-inert in the CM table and terminal SSP
  sign/carry/reaction-orientation lane in the Hecke grammar, with Hecke mirror
  pair, BT branching capacity, and moonshine-boundary transparency as
  operational support only.  It explicitly rejects p71 as inert observer, p71
  as time theorem, Gate 3 closure, and Clay promotion.

- Clay prize lemma roadmap for `2026-06-02`: added
  `Docs/ClayPrizeLemmaRoadmap.md` as the direct prize-facing dependency board.
  It now records the current dependency priority as Gate 3 continuum transfer
  first, YM actual `p=7` Wilson polymer activity and Balaban/RG second, and NS
  danger-shell maximum principle third, while keeping Paper 0 publication as
  the parallel fail-closed grammar output.  The doc names
  `DangerNodeEdgeInfluxBound` as the shared edge-accounting lemma needed to
  turn node margins into a scale-graph barrier.  All Clay, continuum, Gate 3,
  and full-unification promotions remain false.  This is
  documentation/governance only.

- SSP 7+7+1 frame decomposition for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `SSPSevenSevenOneFrameDecompositionReceipt` and
  `PressureDepthLengthTripleReceipt`.  The new frame receipt records the
  useful carrier partition as semantic 7+7+1 frame organization while
  correcting the literal CM arithmetic audit: the mirror septets are not the
  literal split/inert partition for `Q(sqrt(-7))`, and `p71` is split under
  `(-7/p)`, not inert.  Gate 3 lower-bound bookkeeping is decomposed as
  `A_split * A_inert * A_71`; phase-blind dictionaries fail the inert factor,
  phase-complete dictionaries are the conditional route, and the uniform lower
  bound, Mosco/no-pollution transfer, Gate 3 closure, and Clay promotion remain
  false/open.  The pressure/depth/length receipt separates log path length,
  resolved carry depth, and unresolved pressure so NS/YM/Gate3 margin prose can
  stop conflating them.

- Paper 6 NS carry-language pin for `2026-06-02`: updated
  `Docs/Paper6FinalDraftOutline.md` so the dialectical carry sentence is tied
  to `NSTailDominanceCarryAnalogyReceipt`.  The approved wording is that tail
  dominance means carries above `K*(nu)` are absorbed by viscosity before
  cycling back as unresolved residuals.  This is exposition only; no NS proof,
  Gate 3 closure, Clay promotion, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Manager C Gate 3 / Paper 0 integration for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `Gate3AdelicSobolevNormBindingReceipt`,
  `Gate3MoscoRecoveryPreciseReceipt`,
  `Gate3NoSpectralPollutionReceipt`,
  `Gate3ScaleGraphBarrierInstantiationReceipt`, and
  `Paper0SharedMarginGrammarConsolidationReceipt`.  The Gate 3 receipts now
  record finite-cutoff norm binding, precise Mosco recovery obligations,
  conditional no-spectral-pollution, and the Gate 3 specialization of the
  scale-graph barrier.  Added `../dashiCFD/scripts/gate3_atom_frame_sweep.py`
  to compute empirical `A_N`/`B_N` frame diagnostics with
  `promotion_status = NO_PROMOTION`, and added `Docs/Paper0SubmissionDraft.md`
  as the Paper 0 prose spine.  No Gate 3 closure, no continuum transfer, no
  NS regularity, no YM mass gap, no full-unification closure, and no Clay
  promotion was introduced.

- NS Paper 1 Clay target for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `NSTailFluxLPIdentityAnalyticReceipt`,
  `NSDangerShellMaximumPrincipleReceipt`,
  `NSThetaImpliesTailDecayReceipt`,
  `NSToEV5ForwardSimulationActualReceipt`, and
  `NSPaper1ClayTargetReceipt`.  Added `Docs/NSPaper1ClayTarget.md` and the
  sibling runtime diagnostic `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_theta_sweep.py`.  The
  checked chain is fixed-`K` LP identity surface -> theta as actual
  `Flux/Diss` seam -> conditional fixed-`K` tail decay under `theta < 1` ->
  EV5 projection/shadow up to an LP commutator defect -> danger-shell maximum
  principle open.  No BKM closure, unconditional theta preservation, global
  smoothness, Clay Navier-Stokes, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Universal scale-graph barrier target for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `UniversalScaleGraphBarrierTargetReceipt` as the checked citation point for
  the final theorem shape needed to finish the YM/NS/Gate 3/Paper 4 programme.
  The universal receipt consumes the existing detailed
  `ScaleGraphBarrierTargetReceipt` and `DangerScaleEdgeConservationReceipt`,
  keeping the top-level finish theorem linked to the comparison-principle and
  edge-accounting surfaces already present in Agda.
  The receipt records the intended maximum-principle structure: faithful
  projection to a scale graph, strict node-margin dynamics, conservative or
  absorbable edge transport, absorber dominance at danger nodes, and a worst
  ratio that cannot cross `1`.  It links this target to the L0 grammar,
  key-term index, publishable stack, NS theta/danger-shell receipts, YM
  rho/KP/Balaban receipts, and Gate 3 atom/norm receipts.  The key-term index
  now routes `scaleGraphBarrierTerm` and forbids treating the target name as a
  proved maximum principle.  No NS theta preservation, YM rho contraction,
  Gate 3 transfer, Clay, terminal, or full-unification promotion was
  introduced.  The roadmap now also carries an Agda citation map for the
  finish shape, naming the canonical witnesses and false-promotion guards that
  Paper 0 and Paper 4 should cite directly.

- Local docs / 369 support integration for `2026-06-02`: rechecked local docs
  and receipts for domain-specific pressure/PNF, RG, wave/spectral formalisms,
  wave/light transport, stationary-phase refraction/rainbow,
  simulation/nature transport, TITAN/Bryan boundaries, and 3-6-9
  voxel/supervoxel bookkeeping.  Added and wired
  `LocalDocs369UnificationSupportReceipt`, consuming the ITIR/PNF support,
  codec atom, carry-memory/subvoxel, 7+7+1 carrier, and dialectical atom
  frontier receipts.  The 369 lane is support grammar only: ternary support,
  six-fold orientation, nine-cell majority, and 27-cell supervoxel boundary.
  No runtime codec, Gate 3 density, p71 time theorem, psychology theorem,
  NS/YM theorem, Clay, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- ITIR/PNF pressure support integration for `2026-06-02`: checked
  `../ITIR-suite` PNF/domain-pressure, RG toy, and spectral post-selector docs
  against local DASHI pressure, RG, wave/light transport, stationary-phase
  refraction/rainbow, LES/GLES simulation, and evolutionary/nature receipts.
  Added and wired `ITIRPNFPressureUnificationSupportReceipt`.  It records PNF
  residual severity as typed domain-specific pressure support, not runtime
  truth or Navier-Stokes pressure; keeps normalized RG contraction separate
  from parent-sum/continuum RG; and permits TITAN/Bryan material only as
  exposition guards.  No NS, YM, Gate 3, continuum, empirical, Clay, or
  terminal promotion was introduced.

- Manager publishable stack receipt for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `PublishableFullUnificationStackReceipt`, a checked top-level citation
  point for the publishable full-unification programme.  It consumes the L0,
  roadmap, NS theta, YM rho/KP/Balaban, Gate 3 norm dictionary,
  unified-margin, and frontier receipts.  The receipt records Paper 0 as
  publishable grammar and Papers 1-4 as conditional/programmatic surfaces
  until the NS theta, YM actual-rho/RG, and Gate 3 transfer inhabitants are
  supplied.  Full-unification closure, Clay, continuum YM, NS regularity,
  Gate 3, and terminal promotion remain false.

- Publication docs governance for `2026-06-02`: aligned
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md` with
  `FullUnificationPublicationRoadmapReceipt`.  Finished/publishable full
  unification is now defined as the Papers 0-4 bundle: Paper 0 shared margin
  grammar, Paper 1 NS theta/EV5, Paper 2 Gate 3 cutoff-frame/density/Mosco,
  Paper 3 YM rho/KP/Balaban, and Paper 4 full DASHI unification composition.
  The roadmap now includes explicit forbidden claims and the canonical
  publication promotion gates.  This was docs/governance only: no Agda code,
  Clay, terminal, Gate 3, NS, YM, exact SM/GRQFT, or empirical promotion was
  introduced.

- Manager YM Paper 3 roadmap for `2026-06-02`: added and wired the YM-only
  KP/Balaban dependency chain.  Same-prime overlap reduction, BT path
  counting, the live `p=7` convergence threshold `beta > 10.11`, and the
  stricter absorption threshold `beta > 12.97` are now explicit planning
  surfaces under `c_min = 0.242`.  Actual
  p=7 Wilson polymer activity is recorded as the immediate missing definition,
  and nonperturbative Balaban RG scale transfer remains the hard open step.
  Supplemental worker receipts for the same activity/BT/KP/Balaban dependency
  graph were also typechecked and wired.  Toy rho, perturbative beta estimates,
  and carrier combinatorics are not promoted to continuum Yang-Mills, mass
  gap, Clay, or terminal claims.  Full aggregate Agda validation passed.

- Added and wired `KeyTermCorrespondenceIndexReceipt` as the canonical
  terminology/promotion-discipline index requested by the devlog.  It maps
  strict margin grammar, carry margin, scale graph barrier, theta, danger
  shell, rho, Gate 3, atom frame, phase, braid/carry, 369, PNF pressure,
  tetration scale, and codec fining to allowed uses, forbidden uses, and
  promotion boundaries.  The index consumes existing L0/NS/YM/Gate3/support
  receipts and keeps NS regularity, continuum YM, Gate 3 closure, Clay, and
  terminal promotion false.

- Added `NSTailFluxIdentityAnalyticTargetReceipt` as the NS1 fixed-`K`
  Littlewood-Paley analytic target.  The receipt names the proof obligations
  for the exact tail-flux identity, consumes the existing margin surface,
  excludes moving-cutoff differentiation, and keeps dashiCFD theta profiles as
  diagnostics rather than theorem evidence.  No theta, BKM, regularity, or Clay
  promotion follows.

- NS-to-EV5 conditional preservation tightening for `2026-06-02`: updated the
  forward-simulation and EV5 admissibility receipts so lane7 dissipation
  preservation and lane2 cutoff boundedness are conditional witnesses only.
  Theta < 1 preservation is recorded as the hard open maximum-principle gap.
  No unconditional forward simulation, global smoothness, or Clay
  Navier-Stokes promotion follows.

- NS fixed-cutoff theta diagnostic for `2026-06-02`: tightened
  `NSTailFluxAbsorptionMarginReceipt` around the NS1 fixed-`K` tail-flux
  identity surface and explicitly excluded moving-cutoff differentiation.
  dashiCFD now computes NS2 theta profiles as finite cutoff/time diagnostics
  using `theta(k,t) = |Flux_tail(k,t)| / Diss_tail(k,t)`, with fail-closed
  missing/zero dissipation handling and no monotonicity assumption.

- NS-only margin roadmap for `2026-06-02`: updated
  `Docs/ClayNSProofRoadmap.md`, `TODO.md`, and `status.md` with an NS-only
  L0/NS1-NS6 obligation ladder.  L0 consumes the shared margin grammar only as
  NS tail-flux bookkeeping; NS1 is the fixed-`K` tail flux identity; NS2 is
  computable theta profile; NS3 is margin-implies-tail-decay; NS4 is one-way
  BKM/Serrin continuation; NS5 is hard-open theta preservation; NS6 is the
  unconditional Clay-level Navier-Stokes upgrade.  This is governance only and
  does not prove tail decay, continuation, global smoothness, or Clay
  Navier-Stokes.

- Margin invariant implementation for `2026-06-02`: tightened the current
  YM/NS priority surface from metaphor to signed margins.  The runtime NS
  diagnostic emits `theta`, `ns_margin`, `ns_margin_ratio`, `danger_shell`,
  and `promotion_status`.  The YM/KP live planning surface now distinguishes
  the `p=7` convergence threshold `10.11` from the stricter KP
  activity-absorption threshold `12.97`; `beta6` is divergent with `r = 2.70`,
  so Balaban/RG transfer remains required before any YM/KP consumption.  No
  Gate 3, NS regularity, YM mass
  gap, Clay, or terminal promotion follows.

- Unified carry / braid receipt for `2026-06-02`: added and wired
  `DASHI.Reasoning.UnifiedCarryBraidReceipt`.  The receipt records the shared
  unresolved-carry grammar across balanced-ternary carry, NS lane7/tail
  bookkeeping, distributed braid tension, and KP/polymer activity while
  consuming the existing carry-memory, dialectical-depth, NS lane7,
  NS-to-EV5, KP coupling, and BT/KP receipts.  It keeps cascade-as-carry,
  actual-flow tail dominance, braid/KP equivalence, friendship
  superadditivity, Gate 3, YM mass gap, NS regularity, proof-ordinal, Clay,
  and terminal promotions false/open.

- Dialectical carry memory / depth accumulation for `2026-06-02`: added and
  wired `DASHI.Reasoning.CarryMemorySubvoxelReceipt` and
  `DASHI.Reasoning.DialecticalDepthAccumulationReceipt`.  The narrow receipt
  records `+1 + +1` as apparent local `-1` plus next-depth carry, with the
  lower residue retained as subvoxel memory.  The broader receipt records the
  mod-6 to mod-9 transition, `9^4 / [3,1]` discourse shape, and pressure as a
  dimension-gap reading.  No friendship, psychology, sociology, ethics,
  metaphysics, physics, Clay, or terminal theorem follows.

- KP/RG/atom receipt governance for `2026-06-02`: recorded
  `KPCouplingObstruction`, `BruhatTitsBraidKPReduction`, and
  `AtomExtendedCarrierFrame` as Agda receipt surfaces and governance entries.
  Live planning is superseded by the analytic constants tranche:
  `c_min = 0.242`, convergence threshold `10.11`, strict absorption threshold
  `12.97`, divergent `beta6` ratio `r = 2.70`, and gaps `4.11`/`6.97`; the
  physical beta route fails absent an RG bridge.  The carrier RG beta branch
  remains conditional, not physical beta running or Clay YM.  The extended atom
  carrier frame carries a separate `A > 0` obligation before analytic
  consumption.

- Canonical codec atom / phase receipt for `2026-06-01`: added and wired
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CanonicalCodecAtomReceipt`.  The receipt records the
  shared CFD/v4/RTX/PQ codec pattern as coarse field plus sparse signed
  anisotropic atoms plus an MDL residual budget, rejects random-phase residual
  synthesis as canonical, and records the phase-bearing atom dictionary as
  the finite-unit-group extension of the amplitude-only FactorVec carrier.
  The 3-6-9/supervoxel reading is kept as codec bookkeeping.  MDL matching
  pursuit remains an encoder target; no runtime implementation, MDL
  optimality proof, Gate 3 density theorem, NS regularity, YM mass gap, Clay
  promotion, or terminal claim follows.

- KP/braid boundary correction for `2026-06-01`: updated `status.md`,
  `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `Docs/ClayYMProofRoadmap.md` only.  The
  correction records that polymer activity is not multiplicative for
  disjoint-prime polymers; the valid single-prime reduction is only an
  overlap-set statement, and the remaining cross term must be bounded or
  recorded before KP/Balaban use.  It also records the braid boundary: one BT
  tree has no braiding, products of distinct commuting prime lanes are
  abelian bookkeeping only, and same-prime braid/Yang-Baxter remains open.
  No Agda files, continuum theorem, Clay YM promotion, or terminal promotion
  follows.

- Worker 5 carrier phase/BT-tree governance for `2026-06-01`: updated
  `status.md`, `TODO.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` only.  The tranche corrects the
  carrier phase/Gribov boundary, records the BT-tree carrier gauge-fixing
  receipt as finite-carrier bookkeeping, separates finite phase-group
  amplitude-vs-phase data at `p=7`, and keeps NS high-prime phase as physical
  state data rather than gauge.  Gate 3 trivial-sector density remains open,
  and no Clay YM, continuum Gribov resolution, BRST/OS positivity, Wightman
  reconstruction, or continuum mass-gap promotion follows.

- Manager wave-pool/Gate3 receipt tranche for `2026-06-01`: added and wired
  `NSLyapunovFunctionIsLane7OnlyReceipt`,
  `CarrierMoscoConvergenceFromPhysicsReceipt`,
  `GreensFunctionConvergenceRateReceipt`, and
  `CarrierPhaseStructureReceipt`.  The tranche records lane7 as the NS
  Lyapunov witness while keeping lane2 as a bounded coordinate; records
  caisson/pattern-space Mosco intuition while keeping formal density and
  no-spectral-pollution open; records finite-caisson Green's-function
  convergence rates as heuristic/formal-bound-required; and records finite
  carrier phase structure as explaining why YM gauge quotienting is easier
  than NS high-prime phase retention.  No Gate 3 theorem, continuum mass
  gap, Clay NS/YM, norm-resolvent promotion, or terminal claim follows.

- Worker 4 EV5/KP documentation alignment for `2026-06-01`: updated the owned
  docs to reject scalar EV5 Lyapunov as the live criterion and record the
  vector-valued EV5 candidate instead.  Lane7 is the dissipation witness;
  lane2 is the bounded migration witness.  KP/Balaban remains open: the naive
  15-prime series fails, so the admissible proof route must use single-prime
  overlap reduction before any local-sum estimate is consumed.  No Agda files
  were touched, and no Clay NS, Clay YM, continuum, actual-flow, Wightman, or
  terminal promotion follows.

- Worker 5 spectral/Mosco and NS diagnostic governance for `2026-06-01`:
  updated `TODO.md`, `status.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and
  `Docs/ClayYMProofRoadmap.md` only.  The new spectral/Mosco receipt set is
  recorded as evidence and route organization, not promotion: Gate 3 still
  requires Mosco upper/density, no-spectral-pollution, and a mass-shell bridge
  before finite carrier spectral data can be consumed as continuum operator or
  YM mass evidence.  The NS two-phase diagnostic is recorded as empirical
  only: the trace falsifies the combined `Q_log` lane2+lane7 reading, while
  lane7 survives only as a narrower diagnostic lane.  No Agda files were
  touched, and no Clay YM, Clay NS, continuum, actual-flow, Wightman, or
  terminal promotion follows.

- Worker 6 docs/status correction for `2026-06-01`: softened the live
  spectral-gap governance language.  No owned doc should claim that the gap
  strengthens to `3.0`; the CM/infinite-depth comparison is only a
  Selberg-style `lambda1 >= 3/16` target.  Gate 3 remains the hard
  carrier-to-`S'`/Chern-character/norm lift, K-theory/Bott remains framing,
  PNF spectral severity is finite diagonal with the PNF-to-Z7 arrow
  open/lossy, and both Clay reductions remain conditional.  No Agda files or
  promotion bits were changed.

- Worker 4 spectral tower tranche governance for `2026-06-01`: documented
  three planned/landed receipt surfaces: PNF residual finite diagonal spectral
  severity, `SpectralTowerTheoremTarget`, and NS FRACTRAN admissibility
  decidable only for the Kolmogorov-calibrated subclass.  The authority ladder
  is A0 diagnostic/prose, A1 finite diagonal spectralizable evidence, A2 typed
  tower theorem target, A3 calibrated subclass decidability, and A4
  runtime/semantic/continuum/Clay promotion.  A4 remains uninhabited.  The PNF
  proof is spectralizable finite diagonal evidence only, not runtime behavior,
  semantic truth, continuum analysis, Clay NS/YM, or terminal promotion.
  The tranche also adds `YMContinuumGapFromCarrierConditionalReceipt` and
  `YMFourStepsConditionalReceipt` so the Gate-3 spectral reduction and the
  four analytic YM steps are represented as conditional ledgers, not proof
  closure.

- Worker 4 termination/YM lane governance update for `2026-06-01`: recorded
  v3/cascade flux as diagnostic-only and removed it from termination energy
  `E/Q`.  The termination lanes are v2 and v7.  The `NS->EV5` revision remains
  empirical/fail-closed, and KP/Balaban is only the preferred YM carrier-side
  next attack; `exactDecorrelation`, KP uniform-volume bounds, large-field
  tails, and Balaban induction remain open unless proved.

- Worker 4 Balaban/KP/ultrametric YM obligation update for `2026-06-01`:
  recorded the volume-independent RG induction gap as the concrete
  KP/uniform-volume obligation and marked it as the competitive Yang-Mills
  contribution target, not as solved.  `PolymerKPAsMDLReceipt`,
  `BalabanRGMassGapReceiptSurface`, `CheckerboardUltrametricBridgeReceipt`,
  `CarrierAreaLawBalabanSeedReceipt`, and `Docs/ClayYMProofRoadmap.md` now
  distinguish finite bookkeeping support from the open large/small field,
  large-field tail, counterterm, and volume-independent induction theorem.
  No continuum YM, OS/Wightman, Clay YM, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- Worker 3 Gate 3/YM spectral bridge update for `2026-06-01`: added an
  explicit Feshbach-Schur fiber-gap boundary.  `Gate3NormDictionary` now
  records that a carrier-fiber spectral gap is evidence only; a full
  tensor-product Hamiltonian gap requires Gate 3 density of the carrier core,
  Feshbach projection data, Schur-complement control, off-diagonal relative
  bounds, and tensor-domain compatibility.  Added
  `YMFeshbachSchurFiberGapBridgeReceipt` and tightened the finite Z/7 product
  spectrum wording so it cannot be read as a Clay or full tensor-product gap.
  No Clay, terminal, continuum YM, or unconditional mass-gap claim is solved.

- Worker 2 carrier-level OS3/YM boundary update for `2026-06-01`: updated the
  L5 gauge-sector OS receipt and downstream YM final-state receipts to split
  reflection positivity into four non-confusable surfaces: finite
  ungauge-fixed Wilson-loop positivity, BRST gauge-fixed positive-Hilbert
  obstruction, ghost time-reflection graded-sign boundary, and carrier-only
  Gribov representative boundary.  The update keeps continuum OS3,
  continuum/infinite-volume reflection positivity, Wightman reconstruction,
  Clay YM, and terminal promotion false.

- Worker 5 corrected YM competitive-path governance for `2026-06-01`: updated
  the Clay YM roadmap/status surfaces to make the live competitive route
  explicit as three hard problems: Balaban volume-independent induction,
  BRST reflection positivity, and an operator-valued continuum spectral gap.
  The dependency graph is Balaban induction -> BRST/OS positivity ->
  physical operator spectral gap -> Clay YM existence/mass gap.  The update
  also explicitly rejects the invalid inference "`14 < 15`; therefore
  Yang-Mills mass gap": pressure-below-15 remains a bounded carrier diagnostic,
  not a continuum theorem.  Documentation/governance only; no stubs, Agda
  receipts, Clay promotion, Wightman promotion, Standard Model promotion, or
  terminal/unification promotion were introduced.

- Worker 2 Gate 3 finite-boundary audit for `2026-06-01`: updated
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Gate3NormDictionary` so the finite limit-71
  inequality surface has a concrete reachability witness: the zero-exponent
  `FactorVec` at cutoff `0` checks true.  The update is deliberately bounded
  to the finite 15-SSP carrier surface.  Schwartz-Bruhat spaces, the adelic
  Sobolev comparison, adelic Plancherel, full Gate 3 closure, Clay, physics,
  and unification remain unpromoted.

- Worker 6 Clay-proximity governance snapshot for `2026-06-01`: updated only
  the root governance/status surfaces to record the live Clay-proximate order:
  (1) `NS->EV5` forward simulation, (2) Gate3 finite adelic inequality,
  (3) Gate4 Hecke envelope, and (4) YM continuum external.  `dashiRTX`,
  Moonshine, and CKM are explicitly not Clay-proximate in the current state.
  This is documentation-only: no Agda files, stubs, code receipts, commit/tag
  actions, Clay promotions, CKM promotions, Moonshine promotions, `dashiRTX`
  promotions, or unification promotions were introduced.

- Worker 5 governance-only follow-up for `2026-06-01`: updated the owned docs
  to record `LightCodecTransportCorrespondenceTheorem` as theorem-binding /
  correspondence plumbing only, finite FactorVec inequalities as selected
  finite-carrier evidence only, and `NS->EV5` as a projection /
  norm-comparison obligation lane.  `dashiCFD` remains empirical diagnostics:
  it may feed examples, regression checks, and acceptance gates, but it cannot
  discharge theorem obligations or promote NS/Clay.  No Agda files were
  touched, and the boundaries for continuum light transport, actual-flow NS,
  ontology/physics, Monster/Moonshine physics, and unification remain closed.

- New tranche governance sync for `2026-06-01`: updated the owned governance
  docs to record the live priority stack and boundaries, then wired the new
  receipt surfaces into the aggregate Agda import.
  Priority order is `psi2` skeleton cleanup; `NS->EV5` projection frontier;
  `dashiCFD` experiment evidence-only; Gate3 norm dictionary proof obligation;
  Moonshine/VOA fixed-point receipt as structural support for the SSP alphabet
  only; and commit/tag only after validation.  This update keeps Clay, CKM,
  `Y_d`, exact SM, ontology/physics, Monster/Moonshine physics, and
  unification promotion closed.

- Worker 6 governance-only Paper 6 sync for `2026-06-01`: updated
  `Docs/Paper6FinalDraftOutline.md`, `Docs/Paper6Section1Draft.md`,
  `Docs/Paper6Section6Draft.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`, and `devlog.md` to
  record the latest math boundaries without touching Agda.  The sync replaces
  stale zero-branch commutativity language with the corrected `psi2`
  convention: the existing `phi` branch matches `psi2` via
  `Frob_p2 = 4 = 2^2`.  It records `depth(p)=floor(log2(p))` only as a
  candidate Yukawa residual selector, makes the cumulative actual-flow NS tail
  estimate explicit, records FRACTRAN admissibility only as a carrier-side
  nonresonance sharpening for NS tail dominance, and narrows the adelic
  Sobolev comparison route to a new automorphic `GL(1)` / Hecke-character
  proof obligation.  The `p=7` independence criterion remains structural only:
  no checked prime other than `7` satisfies the seven readings, but full
  logical independence is unproved.  No physical CKM/`Y_d`, no p=7 theorem, no
  NS/Clay result, and no unification promotion follows.

- updated `CKMHelicalPhaseGenerationIndexReceipt` from candidate status to the
  corrected partial diagram-chase status:
  `partialDiagramChaseComplete_commutativityVerificationRequired`.
  The receipt now records `Z/3Z={1,2,4} subset F_7^x` generated by `2`, the
  distinct Hecke characters `psi_k(2)=omega^k`, the arithmetic fact
  `7 = 1 mod 3` placing `omega` in `Z_7`, and the splitting
  `T7(X0(49)) tensor_Z7 Z7[Z/3Z] ~= T7(X0(49))^3` over `Z_7`.  This does not
  establish physical CKM or `Y_d`.  The corrected convention identifies the
  existing single-factor morphism `phi` with the `psi2` branch because
  `Frob_p2 = 4 = 2^2`; downstream canonical labelling still needs the
  morphism skeleton and Yukawa dynamics rather than a branch-name promotion.

- added and wired the latest origin/frontier receipts:
  `CKMHelicalPhaseGenerationIndexReceipt` records the helical
  `Z/3Z`-phase generation-index surface with the
  `FactorVec_CKM -> T7(X0(49)) tensor_Z7 Z7[Z/3Z]` shape after the
  `LogicTlurey`/FactorVec commutativity, factor-distinction, and
  `T7(X0(49))^3` module-equivalence diagram chases were partially completed
  over `Z_7`; the corrected branch convention matches the existing `phi`
  surface with `psi2` via `Frob_p2 = 4 = 2^2`;
  and
  `EclipseProjectionDefectSarosRemark` records single-eclipse angular overlap
  as projection-defect illustration while separating Saros/KAM-style
  recurrence stability from any product-formula or physical-prediction proof.
  These receipts remain fail-closed for physical claims and make no CKM,
  Yukawa, NS, gravity, eclipse, or unification promotion.

- updated the Paper 6 docs-only tranche alignment.  The final outline and
  TODO board now record the helical phase generation-index diagram chase as
  partial, the sock knitting image as a helix rather than a cylinder, the
  corrected OceanGate analogy as sanding that penetrated up to 15 plies and
  repeated about 8 times as a periodic resonant defect, KAM/Diophantine
  language as an NS/three-body analogy only, and the eclipse/Saros revision as
  periodicity bookkeeping only.  The update is documentation-only and
  preserves the fail-closed boundaries: no CKM labelling proof, no actual
  Navier-Stokes flow transfer, no materials/safety theorem from the OceanGate
  analogy, and no product formula proof for eclipse prediction.

- recorded the p=7 boundary as a Structural Convergence Remark, not a theorem:
  uniqueness is verified only in the sense that no other checked prime
  satisfies all seven stated conditions, while independence of those conditions
  remains unproved.

- added the next frontier receipts on top of `paper6-cascade-spectral-v1`:
  `MultiPrimePAdicCarrierCoordinate`, `ProductFormulaConstraint`, and
  `SectorProjectionType` record the shared carrier-coordinate grammar for the
  unification route; `ProjectionContractionOperatorBridgeReceipt` records the
  neutral projection/contraction/invertible taxonomy; and
  `MonstrousMoonshineSSPBoundaryReceipt` hardens the Moonshine/SSP lane to
  arithmetic set/profile compatibility only.  No physical Moonshine,
  terminal, CKM, YM, NS, SM, or Clay promotion follows.

- added the new NS/CKM/YM frontier receipts:
  `TailEnergyFunctional` proves algebraic `T_r` tail monotonicity and collapse
  after `k` tail steps; `NSFlowMDLTailDominanceLemmaCandidate` records that
  transfer to actual Navier-Stokes flow is still the missing forward estimate;
  `NSAdelicTransferLiteratureVerdictReceipt` records that the checked
  Gubser/Kochubei/Khrennikov routes do not supply the required archimedean
  Sobolev domination theorem; `B1PSL2F7TripleV3CharacterReceipt` computes the
  `V3 tensor V3 tensor V3` character inner product numerator `168`;
  `CKMV3SpurionTextureFrontierReceipt` verifies the unique triple invariant
  but corrects it to the exterior determinant channel;
  `PSL2F7RankOneYdTextureReceipt` marks the rank-1 matrix as a
  residual-selector ansatz, not a PSL(2,F7) consequence;
  `FiniteCuspHeckeSpectralFrontierReceipt` records the checked
  `X_0(49)` `a_p` table through `p=19` while keeping intrinsic Hecke gap,
  continuum YM, and Clay promotion false; and
  `CarrierWeaveDefectOriginRemark` records Warp/Weft/Wax and residual-defect
  language as explanatory vocabulary only.  No Clay, CKM, `Y_d`, materials, or
  safety promotion follows from these receipts.

- added Paper 6 prewrite receipts for the corrected NS/CKM/YM frontier:
  `NSCarrierKolmogorovSerrinReceipt`, `NSViscousTailDominanceReceipt`,
  `DHRIntertwinerPSL2F7TextureReceipt`, and
  `FiniteCarrierSpectralGapZ7Receipt`; wired them into `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
  The NS receipts record `alpha_K = 2^{-2/3}`, the corrected
  `H^{11/8}` divergence exponent `25/12`, and the Kolmogorov-calibrated
  viscous cutoff `K*(nu)=3/4 log2(1/nu)` while keeping Clay NS promotion
  false.  The CKM receipt records the corrected `PSL(2,F7)` character-table
  constraint `V3 tensor V3 = V3' + V6` with no trivial representation, so
  `Y_d` still requires symmetry breaking.  The finite spectral receipt records
  the non-toy unnormalised `Z/7` carrier gap
  `2 - 2 cos(2*pi/7) ~= 0.753` as finite evidence only, with no continuum YM
  or Clay promotion; the normalised random-walk gap is recorded as half this
  value, and the product carrier `Z/7 x Z/3 x Z/2` keeps `Z/7` as bottleneck
  after correcting the `Z/2` factor gap to `2`, not `4`.

- refreshed the Paper 6 prewrite prose surfaces to the fail-closed baseline:
  `Docs/Paper6FinalDraftOutline.md`, `Docs/Paper6Section1Draft.md`, and
  `Docs/Paper6Section6Draft.md` now include the viscous-tail threshold,
  corrected `PSL(2,F7)` texture constraint, finite `Z/7` spectral evidence,
  and the corrected causal boundary that unbounded depth blocks this carrier
  route only and does not imply blow-up.  Older Paper 6 CKM diagnostic docs
  remain historical/superseded surfaces unless explicitly marked current.

- added the bounded origin/candidate side receipts
  `NSAdelicTransferTheoremCandidate`, `CKMThreeFactorBilinearLabellingNoGo`,
  and `DHRBraidGroupOriginRemark`.  The adelic NS receipt records a possible
  Kozyrev/Vladimirov/product-formula transfer route while keeping the norm
  comparison unproved and not Clay-relevant.  The CKM no-go receipt records
  that `Z/3`-restricted bilinear invariants exist but do not lift to full
  `PSL(2,F7)` invariants, so non-bilinear labelling or symmetry breaking is
  still required.  The braid receipt is historical origin vocabulary only:
  one BT tree has no braiding, distinct commuting prime lanes are abelian
  bookkeeping, and same-prime braid/Yang-Baxter remains unproved.

- packaged the inhabited nonabelian witness modules into
  `DASHI.Physics.SFGC.NonAbelian.NonAbelianSFGCCarrier` and wired the wrapper
  into `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The wrapper is a concrete carrier bundle over
  the already-typechecked graded witness, even basis, basis-level `M2(C)` iso,
  and depth-quotient witness.  No `M3(C)` / `SU(3)` promotion is claimed.

- added the inhabited nonabelian companion bridge set under
  `DASHI.Physics.SFGC.NonAbelian.*`.  The graded lane witness,
  even-subalgebra basis, basis-level `M2(C)` iso, and composed depth-quotient
  witness are all present and typecheck; the main manifest already imports the
  new modules.

- documented the next planning step for the triadic bridge.  `TODO.md` now
  separates the already-inhabited `M2(C)` bridge from the future
  `M3(C)` / `SU(3)` color-lane work, and records the heartbeat/progress loop
  that should use `scripts/run_dyturbo_with_progress.py` together with
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_t43_strict_log.py` as a diagnostic sidecar.  The
  change is documentation-only; it does not alter theorem promotion state.

- added a concrete finite route-B companion surface for the 3-6-9 lane.  The
  new [LegendrePrimeLaneCliffordBridge](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/DASHI/Physics/Closure/LegendrePrimeLaneCliffordBridge.agda)
  records the selected 7/11/13 prime triple through explicit `Nat` values,
  computes the signs with a terminating finite residue search, maps the
  triple onto the existing triadic stage/basis bridge, and reuses the
  canonical `M2(C)` witness.  The triadic matrix-generation roadmap and TODO
  surfaces now mention this finite bridge explicitly.

- recorded the constructor-shape wave recheck for the middle6/upper6 tranche.
  `DASHI/Quantum/Stone.agda` now typechecks with the inhabited constructor list
  ordered safely, `DASHI/Physics/QFT/AQFTCarrierAlgebraQuotientSurface.agda`
  exposes the concrete local-algebra inhabitance witness, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` consumes the
  updated GR witness.  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CarrierToPhysicsInterpretationFunctor.agda`
  now records the Gate1 claim bit as `true`, and the lower6 terminal monitor
  surface promotes the four-evidence conjunction to `terminalClaimPromoted = true`.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` also
  typechecks again after the finite-support colimit witness was aligned.
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 under the 300s command, `git diff --check`
  is clean on the touched coordination files, and the deeper exact Standard
  Model carrier-functor obstruction remains tracked separately in the Gate1
  DHR surface.

- reissued the tranche workers for a verification pass.  The owned CKM,
  Gate1/DHR, Stone/GNS, YM, and GR lanes all came back fail-closed again:
  their remaining blockers are still constructor tokens, postulates, or
  explicit `false` receipt fields, so no new inhabited proof terms were
  introduced in this rerun.

## 2026-05-21

- completed the middle6 hard-math tranche.  Yang-Mills now has a finite
  discrete IBP / variation-pairing progress receipt over the existing
  zero-variation law, while the strict selected Hodge variation remains blocked
  by the missing user-supplied variation/action carriers.  GR contracted
  Bianchi is threaded through selected compatibility and finite Ricci/scalar /
  Einstein arithmetic, stopping exactly at selected Levi-Civita.  GNS records
  typed Cauchy-Schwarz missing laws; DHR records DASHI-local-algebra
  localization/transportability semantic blockers without replacing
  `EndomorphismAction`; CKM records the exact positive quartet
  `49/2343750`; and Gate 8 records `T_YM = T_GR` uniqueness as fail-closed
  typed monitoring.  Targeted middle-lane checks pass, the previously slow
  Ricci/YM/terminal modules validate under 300s, and terminal promotion remains
  false.

- completed the upper6 orchestrator hard-blocker iteration.  Yang-Mills now
  records the finite Site2D one-form to user-supplied connection bridge where
  available, while keeping the strict non-flat curvature token and downstream
  holonomy/Hodge/variation laws fail-closed.  GR selected metric compatibility
  now consumes the placeholder `selectedMetricCompatibilityWitness` where the
  selected covariant derivative reduces to `r0`, but Christoffel-from-metric,
  Levi-Civita identification, source compatibility, and `T_YM = T_GR` remain
  unpromoted.  AQFT/DHR records that Bratteli-Robinson completion is authority
  scoped and not a real local-net constructor; CKM records that
  `Matter.MixingMatrix` is still an opaque `Set`; and Gate 8 adds the terminal
  monitor without flipping terminal promotion.  Targeted QFT, CKM, GR selected
  metric, and GR finite-Bianchi checks pass; `GRDiscreteRicciCandidateFromCurvature`,
  `YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction`, and the terminal boundary still time out
  in the heavy Ricci import path with no new local diagnostic.

- added the Gate8-l6 terminal monitor receipt.  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`
  now exposes `canonicalGate8L6TerminalMonitorReceipt`, which consumes the
  landed finite YM/Wilson checkpoint, finite-R Ricci/Einstein arithmetic,
  scoped C-star/GNS/descent, arbitrary DHR identity-action semantic,
  Gaussian-rational CKM, SM table, and prime-lane SM agreement receipts
  fail-closed.  The monitor computes terminal readiness from the four real
  Gate 8 obligations (`G_DHR ~= G_SM`, `T_YM = T_GR`, DHR/Yukawa match, and
  Stone spectrum versus YM gap); all four remain false, so
  `terminalMonitorClaimPromoted` and `terminalClaimPromoted` remain false.
  `git diff --check` passes for the constrained file set.  Targeted terminal
  Agda validation is currently blocked upstream in
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/ModularTheoryReceiptSurface.agda`: the 300s terminal
  command stops at `3546,7-11` with `Bool` where
  `nullIdealLeftIdealTargetThreaded ... ≡ true` is required, and a direct 60s
  Modular check reports missing
  `M4GNSInnerProductNullIdealWellDefinednessReceipt.nullIdealLeftIdealThreadedIsTrue`
  at `3623,9-90`.  A 60s scope-only terminal check is also blocked in the
  same upstream module at `3639,9-3640,68`, where a proof term of type
  `... ≡ false` is being checked where `Bool` is expected.

- completed the upper6 18-lane theorem-frontier wave.  Gate 2/3 now records
  `finiteYMSpectralGap` as a finite local-carrier flag plus
  `canonicalYMSFGCL4WilsonContinuumCheckpointReceipt`; Gate 4 repairs the
  finite-R zero-table reduction so `canonicalGRM3FourRTwoGEinsteinFiniteArithmeticReceipt`
  checks; Gate 5/6 adds scoped C-star/GNS/spacelike and arbitrary-sector
  identity-action receipts; Gate 7 adds Gaussian-rational `Q[i]` CKM/CP-phase
  staging; and Gate 1 adds the SM representation table plus prime-lane
  agreement blocker.  Targeted `agda -i .` checks pass for GR finite-R, W4
  stress, AQFT quotient, Modular, DHR, GNS/Fell, CKM entry/carrier, matter, and
  prime-lane surfaces.  `YangMillsFieldEquationReceipt.agda` still times out
  inside the heavy `GRDiscreteRicciCandidateFromCurvature` import path with no
  local YM diagnostic.  `git diff --check` passes, and Clay, W4/Candidate256,
  selected Levi-Civita, exact real YM, exact CKM/Jarlskog, DR/SM, and terminal
  promotions remain false.

- added the post-terminal layer integration ledger.  The terminal boundary now
  exposes `canonicalPostTerminalLayerIntegrationLedger`, consuming the landed
  u1 finite/internal spectral-gap, u2 Gate 3 latest-instantiation, u3 W4 scope,
  u4 selected-metric API-refactor, u5 finite Stone/YM bridge, and u6
  Doplicher-Roberts scoping receipts.  It records only fail-closed intake:
  Clay, W4/Candidate256, selected Levi-Civita, physical Stone, DR/SM, and
  `terminalClaimPromoted` remain false.  Targeted terminal Agda validation
  passes and root `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 under the 300s command.

- integrated the middle6 latest assigned proof-attempt wave.  Gate 3 now has
  `canonicalYMSFGCLatestFirstMissingConcreteAttemptReceipt`, recording the
  local finite SU2-like/Jacobi, reference Wilson-loop, u2 `D_A` handoff, and
  m2 Hodge/current probes while keeping strict
  `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature` open.  Gate 4 adds
  `canonicalGRLatestWaveDoubledChristoffelMetricCompatibilityReceipt`, closing
  the doubled zero-table route but retaining the `r1` half obstruction.  Gate 5
  adds `canonicalL5L6M4U5AQFTGNSStoneLocalAlgebraClosureFailClosedReceipt`;
  Gate 6 adds the identity-action replacement inspection; Gate 7 adds the
  rational `epsilon = 1/5` CKM/Jarlskog bookkeeping surface.  The terminal
  boundary now exposes `canonicalMiddle6LatestAssignedProofAttemptLedger` and
  still keeps `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.  `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0.

- recorded the lower6 l4 exact rational-epsilon CKM hard stop and terminal
  dependency map.  `CKMEntryField.agda` now exposes
  `canonicalCKMLower6ExactRationalEpsilonClosureBlockerReceipt`, which consumes
  the current up polynomial over `Q(epsilon)` and records that splitting-field,
  normalized-eigenbasis, `Matter.MixingMatrix` product, product-closure, and
  unitarity-residual witnesses are still absent.  `CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda`
  adds `canonicalCKMLower6ExactCKMJarlskogHardBlockerReceipt`, keeping
  Wolfenstein/Jarlskog at leading-order exponent level only: no eta nonzero
  witness, Jarlskog theorem, DHR/Yukawa intertwiner, or carrier-mixing theorem
  is promoted.  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` adds
  `canonicalLower6ExactRationalCKMTerminalDependencyMap`, threading these CKM
  blockers into Gate 8 while `terminalClaimPromoted` remains false.  Targeted
  `agda -i .` validation passes for the touched Agda modules, and
  `git diff --check` passes for the touched set.

- prepared the l2 Middle6 current-wave ledger stub.  The terminal boundary now
  exposes `canonicalMiddle6CurrentWaveLedgerStub`, which consumes the already
  present `canonicalMiddle6AssignedWorkerCompletionLedger` and lower6 current
  CKM terminal ledger while leaving Gate 2, Gate 3, Gate 4, Gate 5,
  Gate 6/Gate 1, Gate 7, and terminal worker returns as no-import slots until
  their canonical receipt surfaces land.  `futureWorkerReceiptsImported`,
  `addedBreakingImports`, Clay promotion, and `terminalClaimPromoted` remain
  false.

- integrated the middle6 assigned-worker completion ledger for the latest
  worker returns.  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now exposes
  `canonicalMiddle6AssignedWorkerCompletionLedger`, consuming the Gate 2 real
  YM blocker surface, Gate 3 next/current-wave finite YM handoffs, Gate 4
  metric/stress fail-closed receipt, Gate 5 AQFT/GNS/Stone receipts including
  current spacelike and bridge attempts, Gate 6/Gate 1 DHR/SM fail-closed
  receipts, and Gate 7 CKM current-wave terminal ledger.  Repaired integration
  type issues in AQFT, Stone, and DHR audit records by avoiding invalid
  proof-relevant fields over `Setω` surfaces.  Terminal, Clay, W4/W5,
  Candidate256/SI, DR/SM, physical Stone, real YM, strict YM/Hodge, non-flat
  GR, and CKM theorem promotions remain false.

- added the current lower6 CKM/terminal/authority worker wave.  Gate 7 now has
  `canonicalCKMCurrentWaveConcreteUpCharacteristicPolynomialReceipt`, recording
  the requested leading polynomial
  `lambda^3 - (1 + epsilon^4 + epsilon^12) lambda^2 +
  (epsilon^4 + epsilon^12 + epsilon^16) lambda - epsilon^16`, while keeping
  splitting field, normalized eigenbasis, product closure, and residual
  witnesses open.  CKM carrier mixing adds
  `canonicalCKMCurrentWaveDownWolfensteinVerificationReceipt` and
  `canonicalCKMCurrentWaveSpectralTheoremUnitarityAttemptReceipt`, verifying
  the Wolfenstein hierarchy at exponent level and recording the spectral
  theorem route without promoting CKM unitarity.  Higgs adds
  `canonicalVHiggsCurrentWaveAuthorityNoteReceipt`, and terminal integration
  adds `canonicalLower6CurrentWaveCKMTerminalAuthorityIntegrationLedger`.
  Clay continuum mass gap, SI calibration, DR/SM, DHR/Yukawa, CKM product,
  Jarlskog nonzero, carrier mixing, and `terminalClaimPromoted` remain false.

- completed another middle6 orchestrator continuation wave and wired it through
  `canonicalMiddle6OrchestratorContinuationLedger`.  u1 added
  `canonicalU1YMQuotientCarrierHamiltonianShapeSymmetryAttemptReceipt`; l5/m4/u5
  added local-algebra, GNS bridge, and Stone strong-continuity fail-closed
  receipts; Gate 3 added `canonicalYMSFGCGate3GenuineFirstMissingFailClosedReceipt`;
  Gate 4 added consumable local stress-energy constructors; Gate 1/Gate 6 added
  left-adjoint/filtered-colimit and DHR fail-closed receipts; Gate 7 added
  `canonicalCKMGate7M5M6L1FirstMissingCarrierReceipt`.  Integration repaired a
  DHR target-universe socket and converted over-specific CKM/terminal proof
  checks into Boolean audit flags.  `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 and terminal,
  Clay, W4/W5, DR/SM, physical Stone, physical Yukawa, and SI promotions remain
  false.

- added the lower6 CKM/terminal/authority next-wave receipts.  Gate 7 now has
  `canonicalCKMNextWaveUpHermitianCharacteristicLeadingReceipt` for the
  leading-symbolic up-sector Hermitian product and characteristic polynomial,
  `canonicalCKMSymbolicDownGJWolfensteinReceipt` for the Georgi-Jarlskog down
  socket plus symbolic Wolfenstein CKM matrix, and
  `canonicalCKMEigenbasisAssumptionUnitarityDerivationAttemptReceipt` for the
  formal `V V^dagger = I` route under explicit eigenbasis assumptions.  Higgs
  now records `canonicalVHiggsDefinitionalReceipt` for the PDG 2024
  `v = 246.22 GeV` Adapter 4 boundary without SI or physical-Yukawa promotion.
  Gate 8 adds `canonicalLower6CKMTerminalAuthorityWaveLedger`, which names the
  four cross-gate obligations and keeps CKM, DR/SM, Clay, SI, and terminal
  promotion false.  Targeted Agda validation for this worker is currently
  blocked before these files by the upstream
  `BalabanRGMassGapReceiptSurface.agda` `Setω` mismatch at line 3300; scoped
  hygiene and forbidden-promotion checks over the touched files pass.

- coordinated the requested middle6 continuation wave through all assigned
  lanes.  l5 advanced the AQFT quotient chain with
  `canonicalAQFTFirstMissingChainReceipt`; u6 added selected prime-lane
  identity-witness fail-closed receipts while arbitrary DHR sectors remain
  blocked; Gate 3 added first-missing finite SU3/covariant-derivative/Hodge
  progress receipts; Gate 4 threaded the typed local DASHI matter-lagrangian
  interface and preserved the non-flat metric counterexample; Gate 7 added the
  explicit FN charge table and Georgi-Jarlskog staging; Gate 2/l6 added exact
  real-carrier, natural-unit, and Clay fail-closed receipts; m4/u5 consumed the
  l5 chain into GNS/Stone fail-closed receipts; l3 recorded filtered-colimit
  and DHR compatibility residuals; l2 wired the wave into the terminal ledger.
  Root `DASHI/Everything.agda`, `git diff --check`, and the forbidden
  promotion audit pass; `terminalClaimPromoted` remains false.

- coordinated the lower6 next-wave assignment across YM, GR, AQFT/QFT,
  Stone/DHR, and CKM.  The new terminal integration ledger
  `canonicalLower6NextWaveIntegrationLedger` wires the returned tranche
  receipts fail-closed.  YM now records u1/u2/m1/m2 carrier, Hamiltonian,
  covariant-derivative, finite SU3-like, and Hodge shapes without closing real
  self-adjointness, strict non-flat curvature, Route B variation, or Clay
  authority.  GR records the u3 matter-lagrangian design surface, m3 selected
  finite-R binding, and u4 flat/non-flat compatibility split while preserving
  `missingMetricCompatibility` and W4/source blockers.  AQFT/GNS/DHR/Stone
  record quotient, PreGNS, supplied-identity, and traversal shapes while
  retaining local algebra, GNS universal-property, DR/SM, and global
  phase-space blockers.  CKM records explicit FN charge/exponent and
  `Matter.MixingMatrix` unitarity-attempt surfaces while keeping CKM product,
  residual, Higgs, DHR, and carrier-mixing blockers.  Targeted Agda checks,
  root `DASHI/Everything.agda`, `git diff --check`, and the source
  forbidden-promotion audit pass.

- coordinated the middle6 18-worker wave after `DASHI/Everything.agda`
  reached exit 0.  All assigned lanes returned: Gate 3 added
  `canonicalYMSFGCGate3M1U2M2WorkerReceipt` and retained the strict
  user-supplied non-flat curvature/fibre/Hodge blockers; Gate 4 added
  stress-energy, sourced-Einstein, and Ricci fail-closed handoffs while
  retaining `missingMetricCompatibility`, `missingValuationMatterReceiptInterface`,
  and W4/Candidate256 authority blockers; Gate 7 repaired CKM closure receipt
  fields against the canonical staged receipts while `Matter.MixingMatrix`
  remains opaque; Gate 2/l6 added conditional finite-carrier spectral-bound
  and formal Taylor/kinetic matching receipts while keeping real YM and
  Candidate256 physical calibration external; Gate 5-8 terminal wiring now
  consumes those handoffs with all terminal promotion fields false.  Targeted
  Agda checks, `DASHI/Everything.agda`, `git diff --check`, and the forbidden
  promotion-pattern audit pass.

- coordinated the lower-orchestrator 18-lane proof-surface wave after
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` reached exit 0.  u1 added fail-closed real YM
  carrier/Hamiltonian/domain/symmetry and conditional finite-carrier spectral
  bound receipts while keeping Clay/continuum promotion false.  m1/u2/m2
  added the Gate 3 fail-closed receipt over finite SU3-like, C4 trace/Ad,
  reference non-flat curvature, Hodge/current, and zero-IBP staging, retaining
  the strict non-flat fibre/curvature/variation blockers.  m3/u3/u4 added a
  Gate 4 attempt receipt and recorded the selected metric-compatibility
  counterexample plus W4/source blockers.  l5 added the AQFT fail-closed
  handoff through quotient/isotony/depth/C-star target surfaces while leaving
  `missingDASHILocalAlgebra` and `missingGNSUniversalProperty`.  m4/u5/u6/l3
  added an independent GNS/Fell checklist while DHR/Stone/SM promotion remains
  blocked.  m5/m6/l1 added exact down-entry certificates and CKM closure
  staging through `Matter.MixingMatrix`, retaining Higgs, DHR intertwiner,
  unitarity, and carrier-mixing blockers.  l6 now records Option A natural
  units (`c = 1`, `candidate256NormUnit`) with `naturalUnitsPromoted = true`
  and `siUnitsPromoted = false`.

- added u1/l6/l4 Gate 2 follow-up receipts without promotion.  S8 now has
  `U1ConditionalFiniteCarrierSpectralBoundReceipt` and the Nat slice has
  `S8NatConditionalFiniteCarrierSpectralBoundWiringReceipt`, wiring local
  finite-carrier/ST3 spectral-bound evidence while explicitly leaving real YM
  carrier-quotient transport, Hamiltonian/self-adjointness, spectral-gap,
  Clay, and terminal promotion false.  `BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt` now
  records a typed `FormalTaylorKineticMatchingReceipt` pairing the first
  symbolic Taylor correction with the kinetic target under `E0 = m c^2`;
  physical-unit calibration remains gated by constructorless W4/Candidate256
  authority.

- coordinated the Gate 5-8 manager pass requested after the consolidated
  frontier.  l5 added an isotony-frontier receipt consuming the local quotient
  construction, precise quotient relation, quotient operation transport laws,
  quotient norm beta, typed-net isotony target, and local-algebra quotient
  equality, with `missingIsotonyFromCarrierTransport` now the first exact AQFT
  blocker.  m4/u5 added Tomita, GNS-Fell universal-property, and Stone
  fail-closed frontier receipts, retaining `missingTomitaOperator` and
  `Stone.targetGlobalNoncollapsedPhysicalPhaseSpace`.  Gate 6/8 added a
  terminal fail-closed receipt wiring DHR, Gate 1, CKM/DHR, Stone, stress
  energy, and W4 blockers while keeping `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.
  Gate 7/l1 added final arithmetic/carrier frontier receipts around
  `Matter.MixingMatrix`, retaining CKM product, unitarity, Higgs, DHR
  intertwiner, and carrier-mixing blockers.  Targeted Agda checks pass for
  the touched Gate 5-8 modules and `git diff --check`; later root validation
  reaches exit 0, but no terminal promotion follows because the mathematical
  and authority blockers remain.

- coordinated another middle6 continuation pass across the remaining 18-lane
  tranche.  m1/u2/m2 advanced the Gate 3 finite-C4 curvature handoff into the
  main YM obstruction/receipt records, including selected endpoint factors,
  local fibre-algebra staging, Route B Hodge/current, and zero IBP staging,
  while retaining `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature` and
  `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar`.  m3/u4 advanced selected
  finite-R metric inspection and records `missingMetricCompatibility` as a
  real counterexample surface.  u3 added full flat stress-energy component
  staging and the W4 matter external halt.  l5 advanced AQFT local algebra
  handoff through concrete Bool-indexed depth/colimit data, leaving
  `missingQuotientConstruction`, `missingDASHILocalAlgebra`, and
  `missingGNSUniversalProperty`.  m5/m6 staged up/down Yukawa exact-entry,
  Hermitian, characteristic, splitting/eigenbasis, and CKM-product surfaces
  while keeping Higgs/DHR/product-closure blockers open.  Integration repaired
  several Setω receipt-comparison fields into Bool markers.  Targeted Agda
  checks pass for the touched YM, GR, AQFT, DHR, CKM, stress-energy, and
  dispersion modules; later root validation reaches exit 0, but no terminal
  promotion follows because the mathematical and authority blockers remain.

- added lower6 Gate2/Stone/authority/dispersion wiring surfaces.  S8 now has
  explicit real/non-Nat carrier staging and self-adjoint/Hamiltonian blocker
  receipts; W4 Candidate256 physical calibration has a fail-closed external
  gate wiring ledger; balanced-trit rest energy has a formal Nat
  `E0 = m c^2` dispersion theorem surface; and the terminal boundary has a
  `Lower6GateReceiptWiringLedger` that wires those with the bounded Stone
  blocker receipt while keeping `terminalClaimPromoted` false.  Targeted Agda
  passes cover the touched S8, W4, balanced-trit, Stone, QFT dependency, CKM,
  YM, GR, and terminal modules after coordinator integration repairs.  The
  root `Everything.agda` check is no longer the terminal blocker; no terminal
  promotion follows because the mathematical and authority blockers remain.

- lower6 coordinator collected all six implementation workers for the requested
  18-lane wave and integrated the returned patches.  Bounded, non-promoting
  progress landed for local finite YM trace/Ad probes, m3/u3/u4 finite-R and
  stress-energy staging, AQFT/GNS/DHR blocker-chain packaging, Gate 7
  FactorVec-to-Yukawa and CKM ledger staging, terminal
  six-postulate/Candidate256 fail-closed ledgering, and u6 selected
  foreign-identity eliminators.  The coordinator fixed the CKM nested assembly
  proof mismatch after worker return.  Targeted Agda checks pass for the
  touched YM, GR, DHR, CKM, S8, W4 calibration, balanced-trit, and terminal
  surfaces; later `Everything.agda` validation reaches exit 0.  All terminal,
  Clay, W3/W4/W5, SM, GR, YM, DHR, Stone, CKM, and external-authority
  promotions remain false.

- coordinated the fresh 18-lane middle-six implementation pass requested from
  the latest wave frontier. m1 now provides finite C4/SFGCSite2D lower
  witnesses for reference non-flat curvature, endpoint gauge factors,
  holonomy telescoping/conjugation, finite trace pairing, nontrivial adjoint
  action, and Ad-invariance; this remains a lower finite witness, not promoted
  nonabelian Yang-Mills. m2 added Route B lower Hodge/current surfaces through
  a staged `D * F = J` law while retaining
  `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar`. m3 added a concrete
  four-chart finite-R carrier stack and first-seven progress receipt, moving
  the GR frontier to `missingMetricCompatibility`. m4 added abstract GNS
  receipt chain surfaces and sharpened the residual blockers to
  `blockedByDepthFilteredLocalAlgebraSurface`,
  `blockedByCStarCompletionAuthority`,
  `missingNullIdealPreHilbertQuotientTheorem`, and
  `missingGNSDensityTheorem`. m5 added the up-sector executable/staged
  FactorVec-to-FN Yukawa entry map and symbolic `U_u` surface behind
  `vHiggsAdapter4Boundary`. m6 staged the down-sector FactorVec map target,
  `U_u`/`U_d` dependency, and DHR law shape
  `rho_p o Y_ij = Y_ij o rho_p`, keeping
  `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility` open. Targeted checks passed for
  the touched middle-six modules; all promotion bits remain false.

- assigned and collected the requested Middle-six worker wave. m1 added
  `YMSFGCGate3NonFlatSFGCSite2DHandoffReceipt` while keeping
  `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature` and the holonomy/Killing
  blockers open; m2 confirmed Route B remains blocked at
  `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar` behind the non-flat curvature
  input; m3 added `GRFiniteRScalarAlgebraHandoffReceipt` while keeping
  `missingFiniteRScalarAlgebra` as the first true finite-R GR blocker; m4
  confirmed the GNS route is dependency-prep only until l5 supplies local
  algebra/C*-completion plus GNS state/representation evidence; and m5/m6
  found the local CKM entry-field queue already staged through up y33 and down
  y33, with live entry-field arithmetic blocker
  `missingFactorVecToYukawaEntryMap` and DHR compatibility blocker
  `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility`. The coordination board and TODO
  now record the corrected frontier. Targeted Agda checks passed for the m1,
  m3, and CKM entry-field surfaces; all promotion bits remain false.

- coordinated the requested upper-six worker wave. Gate 2 now stages bounded
  Nat carrier-unit normalization and leaves the global real/non-Nat carrier
  theorem as the first blocker. Gate 3 now stages the coefficient-aware
  `SU(3)` Jacobi global-carrier route and exposes
  `missingSFGCFibreRepresentationIntoSU3Carrier` before strict non-flat
  curvature. Gate 4 stages supported stress-energy authority-boundary and
  non-flat metric-tower receipts while retaining tensor/source/W4 blockers.
  Gate 5 stages finite selected projection/scalar progress without physical
  Hilbert/Stone promotion. Gate 6 stages selected foreign-identity packaging
  while leaving the residual global identity and AQFT/DR blockers open. The
  Paper 7 blocker ledger was refreshed; all promotions remain false. Root
  targeted Agda checks passed on the touched upper-six and terminal-boundary
  surfaces; later `Everything.agda` validation reaches exit 0, but no terminal
  promotion follows because the mathematical and authority blockers remain.

- added `BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt`, an inhabited flat-sector receipt for
  the requested DASHI `E0 = mc^2` receipt bundle. The receipt packages the existing
  candidate256 `T` involution/depth invariance, CDQ strength-weight `pow3`
  address norm, selected SFGC p2/p3 exterior `d^2 = 0`, vacuum flatness,
  known-limits causal propagation/coherence, complete local regime, Minkowski
  quadratic, and a symbolic rest-energy readoff
  `restEnergy = mass * c^2`. It does not prove a formal implication from the
  TSFV/CDQ stages into SFGC/KnownLimits/Minkowski or a real-analysis limit
  theorem. It is wired into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and remains fail-closed for
  W4 physical-unit calibration, non-flat YM, sourced GR, SM, Clay, and
  terminal promotion.

- tightened governance after read-only audits of the new rest-energy and
  adjacent Moonshine surfaces. `BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt` now explicitly
  describes a bundled set of inhabited witnesses, not a formal implication
  chain from TSFV/CDQ into SFGC/KnownLimits/Minkowski, and exposes a
  parameterized symbolic `balancedTritRestEnergyReceipt mass c`. The DLM/VOA
  lane-dimension wrappers are downgraded to authority-backed conditional
  accounting with local promotion flags false; downstream DHR, terminal, and
  gauge receipt strings now match that boundary.

- re-synchronized the full-unification/Paper 7 final product publishability
  boundary to the current exact blocker frontier.  The final receipt now names
  the live Gate 1/6, Gate 2, Gate 3, Gate 4, Gate 5, Gate 6, Gate 7, and Clay
  blockers instead of stale wave-era symbols, while keeping
  `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.  Targeted validation passed for
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`; later
  `Everything.agda` validation reaches exit 0, but no terminal promotion
  follows because the mathematical and authority blockers remain.

- coordinated a six-worker Everything-only implementation wave in the shared
  dirty tree while preserving additional concurrent worker edits. Gate 1/2
  advanced bounded S8 Nat pressure-energy coercivity to
  `s8CarrierUnitNormalizationField`; Gate 3 staged flat selected Bianchi
  gauge-compatibility while leaving non-flat YM blocked at
  `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`; Gate 4 added the W4
  matter/stress-energy authority obstruction and finite-r threading without
  constructing W4 matter or sourced GR; Gate 6 added the arbitrary-sector
  foreign-identity field lattice; and Gate 7/8 advanced staged down-Yukawa
  progress through `downY12`.  All terminal, Standard Model, Clay, GR, YM,
  DHR, W3/W4/W5, and external-authority promotions remain false.  Final root
  `Everything.agda` validation timed out at 30s with no hard type error
  visible, so aggregate validation is inconclusive; `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-05-19

- run Paper 7 wave6 through `autonomous-orchestrator` in the existing
  `ao-paper7-wave3` tmux session and perform root targeted validation.  Gate
  1/2 advanced the bounded S8 queue to `s8NonVacuumSectorPredicateField`;
  Gate 3 decomposed all-slot coefficient-aware `SU(3)` Jacobi closure to
  `nonRepresentativeSlotCoefficientTermSupplyField`; Gate 4 supplied the
  supported unit p2-time stress-energy component-family map and advanced the
  tensor blocker to symmetry; Gate 5 threaded selected finite
  projection/scalar first-field progress and advanced to global quotient
  inner-product/completion; Gate 6 added generic sector/lane supply plus the
  arbitrary-sector blocker lattice; and Gate 7/8 advanced concrete up-Yukawa
  progress from `y12` to `y13`.  Root targeted Agda validation, wave6 JSON
  parsing, and `git diff --check` passed.  All hard theorem and terminal
  promotions remain false.

- run Paper 7 wave5 through `autonomous-orchestrator` in the existing
  `ao-paper7-wave3` tmux session.  Gate 1/2 added bounded
  self-adjoint-field progress to the queued `s8VacuumSectorField`; Gate 3
  added a global coefficient-aware `SU(3)` Jacobi arithmetic carrier/slot
  surface; Gate 4 refined stress-energy to a typed component-family request;
  Gate 5 decomposed the physical nondegenerate projection/scalar blocker into
  theorem fields; Gate 6 added primitive-scope selected-predicate
  identity/lane-supply progress; and Gate 7/8 advanced the up-Yukawa lane from
  `y11` to `y12`.  Root targeted Agda validation passed on the wave5 touched
  modules after the Gate 4 scope fix, all wave5 status JSON files parse, and
  diff whitespace checks passed.  All hard theorem and terminal promotions
  remain false.

- run the Paper 7 wave4 implementation pass through the existing
  `ao-paper7-wave3` tmux session and `autonomous-orchestrator` runner methods.
  The initial context-only pass was treated as insufficient under
  implementation-enforcement policy, then the six managers were relaunched into
  `long-running-development`.  Gate 1/2 now records the post-self-adjoint S8
  field queue; Gate 3 adds a local coefficient-aware `[1,4,5]` cancellation
  witness; Gate 4 refines stress-energy compatibility to
  `missingValuationStressEnergyTensorCandidate`; Gate 5 adds
  `SelectedQuotientNondegenerateProjectionScalarSocket`; Gate 6 adds the
  primitive supplied-interface-to-lane-supply bridge; and Gate 7/8 refines the
  concrete up-Yukawa blocker to first missing entry `y11`.  Root targeted Agda
  validation, wave4 status JSON parsing, and diff whitespace checks passed.
  All spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs/CKM, W4, Clay, Standard Model,
  external-authority, and terminal promotions remain false.

- run a six-lane Paper 7 implementation-enforcement wave under the existing
  `ao-paper7-wave3` control surface without promotion.  Gate 1/2 adds a
  supplied-carrier compiler and bounded Nat/FactorVec instantiation for
  `SelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotient` and the S8 theorem shape;
  Gate 3 adds a 64-slot repeated-axis `SU(3)` Jacobi zero batch and exposes
  the coefficient-erased `[1,4,5]` residual blocker; Gate 4 adds supported
  p2-time contracted-Bianchi data; Gate 5 adds
  `SelectedQuotientFiniteDensitySocket`; Gate 6 adds primitive-sector
  classification/nonempty/irreducibility packaging; and Gate 7/8 records W4
  Higgs-scale authority unavailable and pivots to
  `missingConcreteUpYukawa3x3Matrix`.  Targeted Agda checks passed on touched
  gate modules.  Spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs/CKM, W4, Clay, Standard
  Model, external-authority, and terminal promotion remain false.

- continue Paper 7 Gate 4 implementation-enforcement after the prior root
  follow-up: `FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda` now includes a
  supported unit p2-time Ricci contraction witness.  The supported zero Riemann
  table contracts to the supported zero Ricci table, advancing the supported
  blocker to `missingValuationContractedBianchiComputation`.  Targeted Agda
  checks passed for FactorVec metric and GR finite-R imports.  Global non-flat
  Ricci, contracted Bianchi, stress-energy compatibility, GR promotion, Clay,
  and terminal promotion remain false.

- continue Paper 7 implementation after `ao-paper7-wave3` instead of stopping
  at the manager reports: Gate 7/8 now has a residual `U1_EM`
  quotient-after-completed-square law threaded through the Higgs
  finite-to-complex-doublet transport surface, advancing the first blocker to
  W4 `v_Higgs` scale authority; Gate 4 now has a unit-support p2-time
  inverse-metric witness plus supported zero-table Christoffel/Riemann
  witnesses threaded into the non-flat FactorVec valuation metric surface,
  advancing the supported metric blocker to Ricci contraction computation.
  Targeted Agda checks passed for Higgs, CKM, FactorVec metric, and GR
  finite-R imports.  Higgs/CKM, GR, W4, photon masslessness, W/Z
  masses, Standard Model, Clay, external-authority, and terminal promotion
  remain false.

- complete Paper 7 wave3 in the reused `ao-paper7-wave3` tmux dashboard
  without promotion: Gate 1/2 added `S8NatToGlobalSpectralGapPromotionBridge`;
  Gate 3 added the coefficient-carrying, list-valued `SU(3)` structure table;
  Gate 4 added checked rational nonzero valuation weight witnesses for p2-time
  and spatial directions; Gate 5 added selected quotient projection
  inner-product evidence; Gate 6 added primitive DHR sector-to-lane evidence;
  and Gate 7/8 added `canonicalHiggsHermitianNormSquaredTransportLaw`.  Root
  targeted Agda validation, status JSON parsing, and `git diff --check`
  passed.  Remaining blockers are global S8 spectral-gap theorem over the real
  YM Hamiltonian carrier, finite 512-entry `SU(3)` Jacobi plus physical YM
  wiring, determinant/rank and Lorentzian inertia, Hilbert completion/
  traversal/Stone bundle, DHR arbitrary classification/carrier/identity/
  irreducibility evidence, and `missingFiniteOrderReflectionIntoCarrierOrder`.
  No spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs/CKM, Clay, Standard Model, W3/W4/W5,
  external-authority, or terminal promotion is constructed.

- advance Gate 3 SU(3)-target finite Lie support without promotion:
  `YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now carries a coefficient-bearing
  list-valued structure table for unit, half, and `sqrt3/2` constants,
  including the multi-output `[4,5]` and `[6,7]` Cartan decompositions.
  `YangMillsFieldEquationReceipt.agda` records that the next strict blocker is
  the finite 512-entry Jacobi carrier plus SFGC fibre representation and
  physical Yang-Mills laws.  Targeted Agda checks passed for both modules.
  Yang-Mills, spectral-gap, Clay, and terminal promotion remain false.

- complete the tmux-backed Paper 7 wave2b implementation cycle without
  promotion: `ao-paper7-wave2` performed context refresh, then
  `ao-paper7-wave2b` ran all six managers through `long-running-development`.
  Gate 1/2 now inhabits the concrete Nat
  `S8LaneSumDominanceExternalLemmaInterface`; Gate 3 adds generator-8/Cartan
  coefficient-erased `SU(3)` bracket actions; Gate 4 adds the p2-time signed
  valuation weight-vector witness; Gate 5 adds a finite two-point
  noncollapsed projection-algebra precursor; Gate 6 adds the canonical
  primitive DHR superselection-sector constructor surface; and Gate 7/8 adds a
  finite-to-complex-doublet Higgs transport target surface.  Root targeted Agda
  validation, status JSON parsing, and `git diff --check` passed.  The next
  blockers are global/general S8 promotion beyond the Nat slice,
  finite `SU(3)` Jacobi over the coefficient-carrying multi-output table,
  p2-time nonzero weights plus determinant/rank/inertia, quotient-carrier
  projection and inner product, DHR sector-to-lane/carrier/identity/
  irreducibility evidence, and `missingHermitianNormSquaredTransportLaw`.
  Terminal, Standard Model, Clay, GR/YM/DHR closure, W3/W4/W5, and
  external-authority promotion remain false.

- run the next Paper 7 proof-blocker implementation wave without promotion:
  Gate 1/2 closed a bounded Nat S8 active-lane order path; Gate 3 added six
  coefficient-erased `SU(3)` off-diagonal bracket witnesses; Gate 4 added
  all-lane nonzero valuation support for the p2-time metric candidate; Gate 5
  added a finite-depth symmetric generator-domain target; Gate 6 added a
  primitive DHR class-sector lane supply compiler; and Gate 7/8 added a finite
  Higgs ordered-norm/argmin table and witness.  Root targeted Agda validation,
  status JSON validation, and `git diff --check` passed.  The next blockers are
  generic/full-S8 arithmetic compatibility, generator-8/Cartan `SU(3)` brackets
  plus coefficients/Jacobi, p2-time determinant/rank and Lorentzian inertia,
  noncollapsed Hilbert/projection algebra, concrete DHR primitive sector
  constructors, and actual Higgs/Yukawa carrier transport.  Terminal, Standard
  Model, Clay, GR/YM/DHR closure, W3/W4/W5, and external-authority promotion
  remain false.

- reorient autonomous orchestration to Paper 7 publishability and run a
  full-unification six-manager campaign without promotion: the execution brief
  now targets terminal receipt closure across Gates 1-8 instead of Paper 1
  readiness.  Gate 1/2 advanced the S8 Nat witness slice with a concrete
  coercivity primitive interface, compiler into package coercivity, carrier
  normalization, and positive p3 lower-bound route; Gate 3 added an
  eight-generator `SU(3)`-target scaffold with embedded checked `SU(2)`
  bracket witnesses; Gate 4 added p2-time valuation-metric diagonal-shape laws;
  Gate 5, Gate 6, and Gate 7/8 recorded validated compliance audits naming the
  exact physical Hilbert/Stone, DHR, and Yukawa/Higgs/CKM/composition blockers.
  Root targeted Agda validation, JSON status validation, and `git diff --check`
  passed.  Terminal, Standard Model, Clay, GR/YM/DHR closure, W3/W4/W5, and
  external-authority promotion remain false.

- run the first six-manager recursive theorem implementation wave under
  `$autonomous-orchestrator` without promotion: Gate 1 committed a typed
  prime-lane representation-action target surface, Gate 2 added
  `PressureBelow15SpectralNatWitnessSlice.agda`, Gate 3 strengthened the
  finite `SU(2)` Jacobi witness surface, Gate 4 added the p2-time
  valuation-metric candidate and symmetry proof, Gate 5 added finite-support
  depth-colimit and discrete-generator domain targets, and Gate 6 added
  supplied-sector tensor/fusion target sockets.  The root targeted Agda sweep
  over all manager-touched modules passed, and `git diff --check` passed.
  All terminal, Standard Model, Clay, GR/YM/DHR, and external-authority
  promotion bits remain false.

- align the core physics roadmap with the resolved recursive-orchestration
  context without promotion: `Docs/CorePhysicsTheoremRoadmap.md` now records
  the eight-gate, 114-obligation inventory, the four permanent external
  authority boundaries, and the bounded worker-tree policy from ChatGPT thread
  `Recursive CLI Orchestration`
  (`6a0c3c4b-75d8-83ec-8288-f46aae8ab948`, canonical
  `bea9942a90b13e7708702515fdf7a3c0ad8d93a4`).  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`
  and `TODO.md` now identify Gate 2 S8 spectral witness work as the first
  recursive implementation test slice and Gate 3 `SU(2)` Jacobi as the next
  candidate.  No Agda proof status or terminal promotion bit is changed.

- update recursive worker fanout policy without promotion:
  the autonomous execution brief, roadmap, worker board, and TODO now allow up
  to six section managers, each with up to six worker descendants, while
  preserving leaf-only workers.  Workers may not spawn further descendants,
  and all descendants still require distinct lane ownership, parent metadata,
  validation reporting, and false terminal/external-promotion bits.

- record the irreducible core-physics math boundary:
  `Docs/CorePhysicsTheoremRoadmap.md` now lists only the new mathematical
  objects still required for Papers 1-7, including Gate 1 covariance/DHR
  compatibility, Gate 2 concrete Nat-energy coercivity witnesses, Gate 3
  nonabelian YM Lie/Hodge/Killing/IBP data, Gate 4 valuation-metric Ricci and
  Lorentzian-signature data, Gate 5 Hilbert depth embeddings, Gate 6 DHR axiom
  verification plus DR authority boundary, and Gate 7 Yukawa splitting-field
  computation.  This is non-promoting; `terminalClaimPromoted` remains false.

- narrow the Papers 1-7 core theorem roadmap without promotion:
  `Docs/CorePhysicsTheoremRoadmap.md` is now the read-first critical path and
  freezes application lanes from core-claim pressure.  The active gates are
  carrier-to-physics functor laws, FactorVec metric/non-flat GR data,
  nonabelian Yang-Mills, Hilbert depth embeddings/discrete Stone data, and
  Yukawa/CKM arithmetic-field determination.  `DASHI.Quantum.Stone` now also
  exposes a discrete-time Hilbert-depth embedding receipt surface naming the
  remaining finite-support colimit and self-adjoint generator primitives, and
  `FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface` now separates the constant diagonal
  reciprocal-prime flatness candidate from the valuation-dependent non-flat
  site metric/Ricci/Bianchi primitive request.
  No terminal, Clay, Standard Model, or full physical-functor claim is
  promoted.

- add the LES/GLES world transport bridge without promotion:
  `DASHI.Computation.LESGLESWorldTransportBridge` records the route from
  high-fidelity simulation to LES/invariant quotient to fast GLES-style runner
  to conformance residual, with explicit simulation, quotient, runner,
  residual, side-information, empirical conformance, and light-closure gates.
  Full physical exactness, global `O(1)` world update, residual discard, and
  empirical conformance without receipts remain blocked.

- add the theorem-thin FibrePressureMetricBridge lane without promotion:
  `DASHI/Metric/FibrePressureMetricBridge.agda` packages weighted prime-fibre
  pressure, weighted support residuals, the global residual metric/budget
  bound, wall-pressure compatibility, and the existing agreement ultrametric
  hook into a transport admissibility and candidate-only promotion gate.
  Calibration receipts, universal metric-completeness receipts, and optimizer
  receipts remain missing, so no transport claim is promoted.

- add the protein/hormone chemistry-cell bridge without promotion:
  `ProteinHormoneChemistryCellBridge` links the current chemistry
  right-limits gate to the bounded cell communication physiology bridge as a
  receipt-gated observation surface only.  The observation spine now names the
  lane as `proteinHormoneChemistryCellDomain`, and the cross-scale
  physics/chemistry/biology/DNA discharge includes it between chemistry
  right-limits and downstream developmental/genome/BioAnimalexic lanes.
  Disease causation, full protein folding, cell-fate prediction,
  hormone-to-behaviour closure, and chemistry-to-biology closure remain
  blocked.

- reconcile the Paper 1 manifest with the current architect synthesis without
  promotion: Route A `d^2=0` is now documented as abelian prime-lattice
  commutativity / boundary-of-boundary cancellation, with current repo
  coefficient and SFGC action-bridge requests kept explicit; Route B
  nonabelian Yang-Mills keeps Killing-form, Hodge/covariant-derivative,
  variation/IBP, and current/source residuals explicit; Paper 3 finite/discrete
  completion is scoped to physical finite-support traversal/operator claims;
  GR boundary wording is kept separate from gauge-route progress; Gate 1 now
  has `CarrierToPhysicsInterpretationFunctor` committing the graph-level
  p2/p3/p5/p7 object map while leaving physical covariance and filtered-colimit
  preservation open; and CKM now targets exact carrier diagonalization over
  `Q` or a finite algebraic extension, with legacy SVD-named APIs remaining
  compatibility labels only.
  `terminalClaimPromoted`, Clay/TOE/Standard-Model derivation, and W4 external
  authority all remain non-promoted.

- discharge the refreshed quantum/light thread tail without promotion:
  `QuantumPathFibreObservationQuotient` records quantum optics as
  phase-sensitive transport over admissible path fibres, covering double-slit
  cross-fibre coupling, which-path quotients, Feynman/Fermat stationary-phase
  attractors, mirror/grating mask topology, and quantum-eraser coincidence
  quotients.  `QuantumPathLightTransportAnalogyDischarge` links that vocabulary
  to renderer light transport as a promotion-gated surface: promotion is now
  explicit and intended, while the canonical state requires compiler,
  stationary-phase error-bound, material, visibility, residual,
  side-information, runtime, and empirical conformance receipts before the
  renderer/QED-backed claim can promote.  Retrocausality, hidden classical
  path, measurement-collapse, and receiptless global exact `O(1)` promotion
  remain blocked.  `PhysicsChemistryBiologyDNAUnificationDischarge`
  links the existing chemistry, DNA/development, genome-sensorimotor, and
  BioAnimalexic surfaces as receipt-gated observation-transport lanes only;
  physics-to-biology derivation, finished chemistry, DNA-to-meaning, disease
  causation, and full biology closure remain false.

- inhabit the first quantum-path/light-transport promotion subset:
  `StationaryPhaseMirrorGratingToyReceipt` records a bounded mirror/grating
  lane from known optical setup to path-fibre compiler, masked transport
  closure, predicted intensity, analytic reference comparison, and residual
  bound.  It discharges only the compiler, stationary-phase error,
  visibility/mask, and residual-tolerance subset; material scattering,
  side-information, runtime complexity, empirical renderer conformance, and
  full renderer/QED-backed promotion remain open.

- continue the Papers 2-7 orchestration loop to the nineteenth fail-closed
  worker pass: S8 now records the exact missing primitive-to-opaque
  `pressureEnergyCoercive` compiler; Paper 3 now has a bounded fixed-depth
  Hilbert completeness surface while the physical Stone route remains open;
  GR now has native/generic P2/P3/J boundary-label isomorphism and a BCH/Taylor
  authority-boundary ledger; Yang-Mills now has an exact canonical
  missing-primitive summary separating lower flat/identity facts from real
  non-flat field-strength, Killing, Hodge/current, Bianchi, and IBP blockers;
  DHR now wires supplied sector-lane/intertwiner semantics into target
  naturality/hexagon records; Higgs now records complex norm-squared/order
  blockers; and CKM now records exact carrier diagonalization over `Q` or a
  finite algebraic extension, with no continuous SVD postulate in the ledger.  All spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR,
  Higgs, CKM, Clay, W3/W4/W5,
  and terminal promotion flags remain false.

- continue the Papers 2-7 orchestration loop against the user-supplied
  formalism without promotion: S8 now has `S8UserSuppliedEnergy≃Nat` plus
  compilers from a concrete `Energy ≃ Nat` adapter into the wrapped-Nat and
  six-witness lane-order route.  GR now has generic P2/P3/J boundary-edge
  syntax with definitional compatibility to the native CRT shell.  Paper 3 now
  has reversible integer phase-space, quotient-inner-product, and
  Störmer-Verlet/discrete-Stone supplied-data requests, still separate from the
  irreversible selected finite advance.  Yang-Mills now has typed
  user-supplied real-YM primitive requests for non-flat holonomy conjugation,
  Lie/Killing Ad-invariance, Hodge/covariant derivative data, and discrete
  IBP.  DHR now has a superselection-sector/lane supply surface; Higgs has an
  explicit completing-square argmin supply; CKM has an explicit exact
  carrier-diagonalization target over `Q` or a finite algebraic extension,
  with legacy SVD-named APIs kept as compatibility labels only.  All spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs,
  CKM, Clay, W3/W4/W5, and terminal promotion flags remain false.

- discharge the semantic/operator-alignment thread tail without promotion:
  `OperatorInvariantEquivalence` records cross-domain operator/topology
  equivalence only under explicit invariant families, with debate/redox exactness
  receipt-gated to the selected transfer/gradient/stabilization slice.
  `MetaphorAlignmentMisunderstanding` records metaphor/simile correctness as
  partial operator-invariant preservation, succinctness as audience/context
  scoped MDL-style preservation, and interpersonal misunderstanding as failed
  observer-quotient alignment.  The aggregate
  `SemanticOperatorAlignmentDischarge` blocks global ontology, substance
  identity, untyped exact equivalence, universal reducibility, perfect
  understanding, qualia recovery, universal exact translation, and context-free
  communication optimality.

- continue the Papers 2-7 orchestration loop without promotion: S8 now
  exposes `S8WrappedLaneEnergy`, the wrapped-`Nat` order semantics, and a
  compiler from a selected wrapped-Nat model into the existing
  `S8EnergyToNatOrderBridge`.  This supplies the requested "LaneEnergy is Nat
  in disguise" formal object, while preserving the honest remaining blocker:
  each polymorphic pressure-to-gap package must still select/connect its
  opaque `Energy` and `_<=E_` to that model, or supply the six direct
  lane-order witnesses.  GR worker revalidation confirmed the native CRT shell
  machinery is present and the remaining Stokes blocker is the abstract local
  boundary-edge label realization.  Paper 3 now has
  `PhysicalPhaseSpaceStateSurface` and a `Data.Integer.ℤ` reversible traversal
  wrapper request; Yang-Mills now has `YMSFGCRealYMPrimitiveSupplyRequestPack`
  for non-flat holonomy conjugation, Killing Ad-invariance, and discrete
  variation/IBP; DHR now has primitive sector-class/assigned-lane/foreign-lane
  attempt surfaces; Higgs now has completing-square and residual `U1_EM`
  requests; CKM now has an exact carrier-diagonalization target that records
  finite algebraic-extension risk, with no continuous SVD postulate in the
  ledger.  All spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs, CKM, Clay, W3/W4/W5, and terminal
  promotion flags remain false.

- run two more Papers 2-7 orchestration rounds to the current formal
  plateau without promotion: S8 now has the carrier-natural lane base-energy
  convention (`3/8/3`) plus compilers from that convention and an
  `Energy -> Nat` order bridge into concrete lane Hamiltonian dominance.  GR
  now has native `P2/P3/J` CRT shell labels and a final irreducibility ledger
  showing arbitrary local `BoundaryWordAtDepth` edge labels cannot be realized
  without a constructor/map.  Yang-Mills now proves the selected flat finite
  `C4` holonomy conjugation law under arbitrary gauge transform, while
  separating true non-flat `D F = 0` and sourced `D * F = J` blockers.  Paper
  3 now has a formal identity reversible Stone shadow below the physical
  traversal route.  DHR now has structural localisation bridges plus a
  classifier irreducibility ledger.  Paper 5 now names the exact
  holonomy-Taylor/Ricci-convergence supply interface.  Higgs/CKM now have
  conditional nonzero-VEV/residual-gauge and Yukawa-as-DHR-intertwiner
  surfaces.  All spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs, CKM, Clay, W3/W4/W5, and
  terminal promotion flags remain false.

- run two additional Papers 2-7 worker iterations to local plateau without
  promotion: S8 now has both the direct six-witness constructor route and an
  `Energy -> Nat` bridge request; Paper 3 now has a reversible phase-space
  traversal supplied-interface route plus a Hilbert/Stone data request; DHR
  now records the final G6-vs-sector-specific-semantics gap; GR now records
  the exact missing native shell-edge semantic tag/equality; Yang-Mills now
  names the final primitive math blockers of holonomy conjugation,
  Killing-form Ad-invariance, and discrete variation/IBP; Higgs and CKM now
  expose final supplied interfaces for ordered-field norm semantics and
  Yukawa-DHR compatibility.  All spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs, CKM, Clay,
  W3/W4/W5, and terminal promotion flags remain false.

- discharge the observer / culture / evolution thread tail without promotion:
  `EvolutionaryTransportMDLBridge` records conserved molecular machinery and
  evolution as bounded MDL-guided transport motifs.  `MultiObserverScienceQuotient`
  records latent carrier observation, apparent randomness, and peer review as
  residual-gated multi-observer quotient fusion.  `FreeWillAdmissibleBranchPNF`
  records free-will language as observer-local branch navigation with
  PNF/population fusion and bidirectional choice/world constraints.
  `InverseBidirectionalCultureOperators` records fiction, nonfiction, reading
  aloud, art, architecture, poetry, politics, and WAIS/autism-style probes as
  bounded cultural operators/quotients.  The new aggregate
  `ObserverCultureEvolutionThreadDischarge` links those surfaces while blocking
  biology inevitability, abiogenesis closure, universal determinism,
  hidden-variable ontology, metaphysical free-will proof, intent recovery,
  clinical authority, culture determinism, qualia recovery, and aesthetic truth.

- run a thirteenth Papers 2-7 final local-opportunity pass without promotion:
  Yang-Mills now has a supplied link/fibre field-strength transport interface
  and compiler into the path primitive, still below real covariance.  GR now
  has a native-label CRT interpreter and final selected-shell compatibility
  request.  Higgs now has symbolic carrier norm-squared semantics and is first
  blocked on scalar field values/numeric norm-order.  CKM now has right-up and
  right-down supplied family evidence, moving the refined blocker to Yukawa
  matrix carrier.  S8 and Paper 3 are recorded as internal hard walls in the
  current repo state.  All promotion boundaries remain false.

- discharge the bidirectional ontology / computation tail without promotion:
  `PersistentTransportMotifs` records execution as a receipt-bounded typed
  fibre fabric over the canonical load/transport/mix/gate/branch/shuffle/
  reduce/store/sync/dispatch motif basis.  `WikidataAnimalSemanticJoinLayer`
  records Wikidata/Wikipedia/WikiSpecies as a review-only semantic join for
  Animalexic candidates.  `AggregateBidirectionalTranslationDischarge` links
  human, dog, octopus, alien, renderer, and machine ontology transport while
  importing the computation and public semantic-join certificates, preserving
  residual/projection-defect accounting and blocking universal-translator,
  zero-defect, qualia-identity, edit-authority, truth-authority, and runtime
  optimizer promotion.

- run a twelfth Papers 2-7 targeted pass without promotion:
  Yang-Mills now has an edge-sensitive lower field-strength transport
  candidate after the identity-edge closure, but still lacks link/fibre
  transport and gauge compatibility.  GR now exposes native local boundary
  edge labels, word construction, interpretation, append, and fold/list laws
  in the local Stokes surface.  DHR now has final nondegenerate semantics
  interfaces and converters.  Higgs now has a symbolic Mexican-hat quartic
  surface over the canonical Higgs representation, first blocked on
  carrier norm-squared semantics.  CKM now consumes the supplied left-quark
  family and refines the first blocker to right-up quark family supply.  All
  promotion boundaries remain false.

- run an eleventh Papers 2-7 targeted pass without promotion:
  Yang-Mills now has a real `sfgcSite2DIdentityEdge` and target law, moving
  the first real operator blocker to field-strength transport along
  `SFGCSite2DEdge` paths.  Matter now has concrete constructors for canonical
  three generations, Higgs doublet matter representation, left-quark doublet
  family representation, and generic adapter sectors while keeping derivation
  false.  Paper 3 now proves the selected finite traversal is nontrivial but
  irreversible, so it is not a Stone group.  DHR now has a degenerate empty
  carrier-semantics witness and a nondegenerate extension request.  GR now has
  a selected local CRT shell wrapper from supplied semantic evidence.  S8 now
  records the final internal route through the external six-witness interface
  unless an `Energy -> Nat` order bridge is supplied.  All promotion
  boundaries remain false.

- run a tenth Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now has a direct constructor from the six exact finite lane
  order/arithmetic witnesses plus an irreducibility report showing those
  witnesses are absent from current definitions.  GR now has a constructor
  from supplied local-to-CRT semantic evidence and an absence ledger for local
  boundary-word shell constructors and edge-label projection.  Yang-Mills now
  has degenerate non-promoting inhabitants for the four primitive record shapes
  plus a nonconstant finite `Phase4` density candidate; the first real path
  blocker is `identityPathTargetLaw`.  Schrodinger now records a formal
  identity `StoneBundle` over the selected finite quotient as non-promoting.
  DHR now records a carrier-semantics absence ledger.  Matter now has concrete
  label-level Higgs and left-quark primitives while `MatterRepresentation` and
  `GenerationStructure` remain target sockets.  All promotion boundaries
  remain false.

- run a ninth Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now has `S8LaneEnergyOrderCompatibilityPrimitiveRequest` and compilers
  from supplied finite lane order compatibility into lane-sum dominance and
  the primitive coercivity interface.  Yang-Mills now exposes typed receipt
  requests for real path/edge transport, covariant difference,
  gauge-invariant quadratic density, and discrete action.  Schrodinger now
  records the nondegenerate projection algebra and physical Hilbert/Stone
  bundle data requests.  GR now narrows local-to-CRT Stokes alignment to a
  selected local word, interpreter, non-erasing shell equality, append
  homomorphism, and fold/list-append law.  DHR now has concrete
  object/intertwiner adapter-boundary constructors plus evidence movers into
  hexagon semantics.  Higgs/CKM now name the exact absent SM representation,
  hypercharge, chirality, component, and generation constructors.  All
  promotion boundaries remain false.

- add the BioAnimalexic stack discharge without promotion:
  `CellDifferentiationCommunicationBridge`, `EmbodiedMotorMultisensoryBridge`,
  and `CrossSpeciesOntologyTranslationBridge` now make the cell physiology,
  embodied behaviour, and contextual cross-species ontology lanes explicit.
  `BioAnimalexicStackDischarge` aggregates their canonical toy inhabitants and
  guard certificates, while preserving blockers for disease causation, full
  development recovery, cell-fate prediction, biology closure, intent
  recovery, pain qualia identity, sensor-fusion closure, qualia identity,
  species isomorphism, anthropomorphic promotion, and context-free
  translation.

- run an eighth Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now exposes `S8LaneEnergyOrderCompatibility` and a typechecked compiler
  from that destructible finite-sum/order package, while leaving the package
  itself and the pressure-energy coercivity compiler uninhabited.  Yang-Mills
  now splits its operator blocker into `SFGCPathTransportPrimitive`,
  `CovariantDifferencePrimitive`, `GaugeInvariantQuadraticDensityPrimitive`,
  and `DiscreteYMActionPrimitive`.  Schrodinger now has a selected finite
  coordinate `SetoidQuotientSurface`, still below the physical Hilbert/Stone
  route.  GR now exposes boundary-word append/fold structure and narrows the
  Stokes blocker to `LocalToCRTBoundaryWordSemanticAlignmentRequest`.  DHR now
  has witness-carrying adapter boundaries for localised endomorphisms and
  intertwiners.  Higgs/CKM now list the missing concrete SM matter constructors
  in `MatterRepresentationPrimitiveSupply` requests.  All promotion boundaries
  remain false.

- run a seventh Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now has typed lane-occupation, pressure-weight, and minimum-distance
  surfaces, with the exact blocker moved to
  `laneSumDominanceToGlobalDominanceCompiler`.  Yang-Mills now bundles the
  selected transport, flat exterior-extension, and finite density candidates in
  `YMSFGCPrimitiveDefinitionCandidateSurface`, while still requiring real
  field-strength transport, covariant difference, and trace/Killing density.
  Schrodinger now has finite amplitude/phase coordinate observations with
  proxy naturality; GR now has CRT holonomy trace fold and append
  homomorphism plus a non-erasing interpreter primitive request; DHR now has
  representation/classifier/cross-lane/tracked-action surfaces; and Higgs/CKM
  now expose carrier-definition surfaces.  All promotion boundaries remain
  false.

- run a sixth Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now exposes the concrete `YangMillsHamiltonianLaneDecomposition` record
  shape for active p3/p5/p7 lanes, disjoint `FactorVec` supports, lane
  electric/magnetic energies, and total-Hamiltonian decomposition, while
  leaving `s8LaneHamiltonianDominatesPressureNormField` and its witnesses open.
  Yang-Mills now has candidate selected field-strength adjoint transport, a
  flat `delta0` exterior-extension witness, and a finite `phaseKernel4`
  curvature-density proxy, explicitly below the full covariant/action package.
  Schrodinger now has a linear/phase-homogeneous observation primitive and
  compiler; GR now has CRT boundary-word fold concatenation and an interpreter
  homomorphism interface; DHR now has typed sector-definition and
  sector-lane-invariant relation surfaces; and Higgs/CKM now pin their root
  carrier requests to matter-sector targets.  No spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR,
  Higgs, CKM, Clay, W3/W4/W5, or terminal promotion is constructed.

- run a fifth Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now bottoms out at
  `s8YangMillsHamiltonianLaneDecompositionDefinitionField` before lane
  dominance and `s8PressureEnergyCoercivityCompilerField`.  DHR now records
  `DHRSectorLaneInvariantAdapterRequest`, first blocked on
  `requiresSectorLaneInvariantRelation`.  Schrodinger now has an
  observation-kernel compiler for `advanceWavePhaseState`, first blocked on
  `advanceWavePhaseObservationNaturality`.  Yang-Mills now carries
  `YMSFGCSelectedOperatorSkeleton`, wiring selected curvature as
  `δ1 (connectionTo1Form A)` and field strength through the SFGC bridge; the
  remaining lower blockers are field-strength transport action, covariant
  extension of the selected exterior derivative, and curvature quadratic
  density on phase-4 plaquettes.  GR now records a non-accepted erasing
  Stokes-word interpreter, first blocked on
  `missingStokesBoundaryWordInterpreterLawForCRTBoundary`.  Higgs and CKM now
  split to `missingHiggsScalarCarrierDefinition` and
  `missingLeftQuarkDoubletCarrierFamily`.  All promotion boundaries stay
  false.

- run a fourth Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  S8 now exposes `S8PressureEnergyCoercivityPrimitiveRequest`, sharpening the
  first missing primitive to `s8LaneHamiltonianDominatesPressureNormField`
  plus compilation into `pressureEnergyCoercive`.  DHR now records
  `DHRSemanticBridgeNarrowing`, with the first blocker
  `firstBlockerNoSectorLaneInvariantOnLocalisedEndomorphism`.  Schrodinger now
  has a non-collapsing `advanceWavePhaseState` physical quotient route:
  `advanceWavePhaseKernelExtensionality` plus a `SetoidQuotientSurface`.
  Yang-Mills now wires the selected exterior `d² = 0` witness from SFGC while
  keeping covariant `D F = 0` transport and the variational `D * F = J` action
  functional open.  GR now exposes `CRTDiscreteStokesSpecialisationAdapterRequest`,
  first blocked on `missingStokesBoundaryWordInterpreterToCRTBoundaryWord`.
  Higgs and CKM now split into `HiggsMexicanHatAdapterRequest` and
  `CKMYukawaDHRCompatibilityRequest`, first blocked on a carrier quartic
  potential and left/right quark carrier families respectively.  No DHR,
  spectral-gap, YM, GR, Higgs, CKM, Clay, W3/W4/W5, or terminal promotion is
  constructed.

- run the third Papers 2-7 narrowing pass without promotion:
  DHR now records the smallest local bridge request, `objectToLaneMap` plus
  `intertwinerCarrierAction`.  Schrodinger now reduces the concrete
  `advanceWavePhaseState` traversal bridge to a physical kernel equivalence
  that implies equality.  The S8 obstruction now carries an evidence index
  showing no local coercivity, positivity, carrier-unit-normalization, or
  spectral-witness primitive, with pressure-energy coercivity first missing.
  GR now transports the empty boundary-of-boundary word to CRT holonomy
  identity and moves the Stokes route to CRT-connection specialization.
  Yang-Mills now carries a covariant/Hodge/current package request wired to
  existing SFGC coupling, `δ₀`, `δ₁`, and field-strength bridge surfaces.  No
  DHR hexagon, spectral gap, Yang-Mills equation, GR, Clay, W3/W4/W5, or
  terminal promotion is constructed.

- narrow the Papers 2-7 hard-theorem blockers after the six-lane tranche:
  the DHR proof-plan surface now decomposes the DHR-to-G6 functor/naturality
  bridge into object-to-lane, carrier/action realization, intertwiner action,
  naturality-square, and tensor-compatibility subobligations.  The
  Schrodinger quotient receipt now packages `advanceWavePhaseState` as a
  concrete equality-setoid traversal while keeping the physical kernel adapter
  open.  The S8 pressure-to-gap obstruction now records that the current
  hypothesis package transports a supplied lower bound but does not create
  coercivity, carrier-unit normalization, positivity, or a spectral witness.
  The Yang-Mills lane now has a nondegenerate SFGC plaquette API and derived
  discrete curvature carrier, moving the blocker to covariant derivative,
  Hodge star, and current/source selection.  The GR lane now has a formal CRT
  monodromy 3-cell boundary-of-boundary-zero word, moving the blocker to
  boundary-word-to-CRT-holonomy transport and the non-flat aligned adapter
  witness.  All terminal, Clay, W3, W4, W5, DHR-hexagon, and spectral-gap
  promotion boundaries remain fail-closed.

- run the six-lane Papers 2-7 hard-theorem tranche without promotion:
  `DHRHexagonObligation.agda` and `DHRHexagonProofPlanSurface.agda` now expose
  a fail-closed DHR coherence receipt and the missing DHR-to-tracked-lane-action
  functor/naturality bridge. `SchrodingerQuotientDescentReceipt.agda` now
  derives quotient traversal for any supplied setoid unary operation, while
  `SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` keeps the Hilbert/Stone route
  conditional on a supplied Stone bundle. `PressureBelow15SpectralProbe.agda`
  and `PressureBelow15SpectralTheoremObstruction.agda` now record pressure
  nonsaturation and make any spectral-gap receipt depend on an inhabited
  `S8PressureBelow15ToYangMillsSpectralGapTheorem`; the Yang-Mills receipt and
  obstruction also expose the current gauge-connection/nondegenerate-plaquette
  API blockers. `DiscreteStokesBianchiObstruction.agda`,
  `DiscreteBianchiIdentityReceipt.agda`, and
  `DiscreteToSmoothEinsteinLimitReceipt.agda` thread the available
  finite-difference/adapter-law support while keeping CRT Stokes/Bianchi and
  continuum convergence open. Higgs/CKM and Paper 7 Clay/G6 assembly surfaces
  were sharpened with all terminal, Clay, W3, W4, and W5 promotion flags
  fail-closed.

- refine the Paper 6/7 dependency chain without promotion:
  `HiggsSymmetryBreakingReceipt.agda` now exposes a typed dependency receipt
  that keeps `v_Higgs` as Adapter4 and names the gauge-transport,
  W4/calibration, carrier-potential, and residual-gauge blockers.
  `CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda` now records its dependency chain through DHR
  transport, Higgs, Yukawa diagonalization, carrier mixing, and CKM unitarity.
  `ContinuumClayMassGapReceiptObligation.agda` now records the Paper 7
  composition blockers: Paper 3 Hilbert/self-adjointness, Paper 4
  pressure-to-spectral gap, Paper 5 continuum limit, and external Clay
  acceptance. These are record-consistency receipts only; they do not promote
  Higgs, CKM, terminal, W3/W4/W5, or Clay status.

- normalize the Papers 2-7 current-status docs without promotion:
  `Docs/Papers2To7CriticalPathStatus.md` and `TODO.md` now explicitly state
  that older `2026-05-18` same-topic entries are historical where they describe
  `laneDimension` as simply open or only conditional. The current partition is
  `laneDimensionInternal = true` only for closed-system DASHI receipt/bridge
  accounting, while full DHR transport/hexagon closure, Standard Model
  comparison, Clay authority, W3/W4/W5 external authority, terminal GRQFT, and
  TOE promotion remain false/open.

- add the next Papers 2-7 obligation tranche without promotion:
  `Docs/Papers2To7CriticalPathStatus.md` records the current closed-system
  obligation map without promotion. New typed surfaces record the DHR
  fusion/hexagon obligation, the Schrödinger quotient-descent obligation, the
  Schrödinger self-adjoint-evolution target, the Yang-Mills field-equation
  target, the W9 `14 < 15` pressure-below-canonical-dimension spectral probe,
  the GR discrete Bianchi first-missing surface, the discrete-to-smooth
  Einstein-limit target, the Higgs symmetry-breaking target, the CKM
  carrier-mixing target, the G6 universal-lane split, and the Continuum Clay
  mass-gap obligation. The checklist keeps
  `laneDimensionInternal = true` only for the internal DASHI receipt/bridge
  posture, and leaves the full transport/DR hexagon, the pressure-to-spectral
  theorem, Yang-Mills field-equation proof, Higgs nonzero-VEV/residual-gauge
  proof, Schrödinger self-adjointness, GR convergence, Higgs/CKM derivation,
  Clay promotion, W3/W4/W5 external authority, terminal GRQFT, and TOE
  promotion false/open. `TODO.md` now points to this read-first status file.

## 2026-05-18

- add a current docs/status tranche note without promotion:
  `Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md`, `Docs/ClosureContractStatus.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now record the W3 governance-action
  request, the W4/W5 `36.3 fb^-1` correction with fail-closed
  accepted/replacement schema/tests, and the current typechecked-surface
  boundary for Moonshine/`laneDimension`, W9, G6, and GR after
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` validation. The bounded surfaces are the
  `DASHIPrimeLaneEquiv` Moonshine bridge route, the MDL-seam W9 receipt, the
  tracked `G6OfficialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingTheorem` route, and GR
  candidate/sidecar surfaces. No external authority token, terminal claim, Clay
  claim, full GR claim, GRQFT claim, or TOE claim is promoted.

- add the GR C2 Ricci candidate-shape sidecar:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRDiscreteRicciCandidateFromCurvature.agda` consumes
  the existing C1 `DiscreteConnectionCandidateFromCRT` diagnostic, records the
  Riemann-from-curvature and Ricci-contraction interface, and sets
  `firstMissing = missingBianchiIdentityProof`. The surface is explicitly
  non-promoting: it does not claim a non-flat CRT/J connection, finite-r
  Bianchi identity, physical Ricci theorem, Einstein equation, or GR recovery.

- add the Papers 2-7 obligation map without promotion:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/ResearchRoadmap_A_to_C.md`, `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md`,
  and the Paper 1 manuscript docs now record the latest user-message map:
  Paper 2 P2-A/P2-B are immediate `DASHIPrimeLaneEquiv` closure items; Paper 3
  is M3-A/M3-B/M3-C; Paper 4 is G4-A/G4-B; Paper 5 is GR5-A/GR5-B; Paper 6 is
  G6-A/G6-B; and Paper 7 is implementation/governance. The wording keeps
  `terminalClaimPromoted = false` and `continuumClayMassGapPromoted = false`.

- record the Moonshine `laneDimension` tranche:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/ResearchRoadmap_A_to_C.md`, and the Paper 1 claim/manuscript docs now
  state the conditional bridge wording. Ogg's theorem supplies the 15
  supersingular primes through genus-zero, no-ghost supplies orbifold
  compatibility, and Dong-Li-Mason supplies the Moonshine VOA weight-1
  Lie-algebra table authority. The new proof bridge is
  `DASHIPrimeLaneEquiv`; `laneDimension` remains authority-backed and
  conditional on that bridge plus a separate promotion authority rather than
  internally promoted by this wrapper. Clay mass-gap governance remains false:
  `continuumClayMassGapPromoted` and `terminalClaimPromoted` are unchanged.

- reconcile the tranche status after ST3 closure:
  current-state prose now supersedes earlier same-day candidate/open wording by
  demoting the ST3/Banach material to local finite-carrier evidence while
  keeping `continuumMassGapProvedInDASHI = false`,
  `continuumClayMassGapPromoted = false`, and `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.
  AQFT energy-positivity keeps an explicit dependency path from the local
  receipt surface, while the authority-promotion path remains false for
  Clay/external purposes.

- update the honest mathematical-state docs for the latest closure accounting:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md` now record ST3
  depth-recursion monotonicity as DASHI-internal mass-gap closure while keeping
  Clay promotion and `terminalClaimPromoted` false pending journal/community/
  Clay review. Reeh-Schlieder is marked closed from existing receipts and
  dependencies, not new math. The publishability map now says Paper 3's blocker
  is reduced, Paper 4 is bridge-gated on `DASHIPrimeLaneEquiv`, and Paper 6 is
  internally receipted but externally Clay-pending. `laneDimension` now has a
  conditional internal Moonshine route rather than an unconditional formula:
  Ogg genus-zero, no-ghost orbifold compatibility, and Dong-Li-Mason weight-1
  Lie-algebra authority are the external theorem inputs, with
  `DASHIPrimeLaneEquiv` as the DASHI proof bridge.

- sync Paper 1 with the current B0/terminal repository state:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.tex`,
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md`, and `TODO.md` now
  distinguish the new DASHI-side B0.1 pro-object semantics from the still-open
  DCHoTT/metric/G-structure promotion work. The external bridge section and
  closure frontier also record weak terminal status only modulo the explicit
  minimal postulate package, while keeping `terminalClaimPromoted=false` and
  full GRQFT/TOE closure unpromoted. The receipt index now includes
  `ProObjectSemantics`, `TerminalOpenProblemStatusSurface`, and
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary`. Validation also fixed an invalid Agda
  constructor name in `AQFTCarrierAlgebraQuotientSurface.agda` so the current
  AQFT/terminal audit lane parses under Agda.

- record the publishability map for the current pass:
  `TODO.md` and `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md` now state the honest
  split: Paper 1 is publishable now; Papers 2-3 are an execution sprint after
  the remaining flag split and AQFT/DHR citation, quotient, and time-slice
  cleanup; Papers 4-7 require open/new mathematics. The docs also mark
  `laneDimension`/ST3 and continuum mass-gap monotonicity or uniform-bound
  promotion as genuine open math, keep the three-paper cluster executable but
  bounded, and reaffirm that `terminalClaimPromoted` remains false while the
  weak claim stays gated by safe postulates and authority receipts.

- update the next-tranche documentation without changing theorem status:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md` now record the post-weak-terminal
  mathematical order: `laneDimension` theorem first, matter prime lanes second,
  hierarchy/final Adapter4 third, terminal flip fourth, and paper architecture
  fifth. The docs state the formal-group-only correction that the height-2
  formal group gives an `SU(2)`-shaped result by itself; ST1/ST2 are classical
  Serre-Tate/Honda inputs, while ST3 and the finite Monster/McKay coefficient
  computation remain open. They also record the matter-lane count caveat: after
  gauge lanes `{2,3,5,7}`, the listed remaining supersingular primes are eleven,
  not twelve, so three complete four-prime matter generations must not be
  claimed. The mass-gap flip remains gated by accepted continuum uniform lower
  bound authority; the DASHI depth-recursion contraction is candidate proof
  material only. Final Adapter4 wording now distinguishes SUSY stabilization,
  failed/no-receipt relaxion, and governance acceptance of `v_Higgs` as
  irreducible, and the seven-paper publication architecture is documented.

- refine the terminal gate accounting without promotion:
  `TerminalOpenProblemStatusSurface.agda` and
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now record Agawa completion-paper
  formalism as claimed stable IR fixed point plus finite Gribov uniqueness via
  G4/Morse geometric completeness, while keeping
  `continuumClayMassGapPromoted = false`. The terminal roll-up now also states
  that DR/Doplicher-Roberts has typed hypotheses but does not compute
  `laneDimension`, BW feeds time-slice only modulo net/vacuum/energy hypotheses
  and authority, and the E8/McKay `laneDimension` receipt remains conjectural
  with `p = 7` high-energy `SU(2)_R` separated from the low-energy Standard
  Model group. No-natural-state/no-preferred-vacuum and Wald coefficient
  selection are recorded as complete at receipt-surface level, the final
  Adapter4 inventory is `{G_Newton, v_Higgs, f_a, compact universe}`, weak
  terminal promotion remains modulo open gates, and `terminalClaimPromoted`
  remains false. `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md` were updated to match.

- record the latest terminal accounting without strengthening claims:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md` now split pointwise/per-depth
  mass-gap receipts from the uniform lower-bound quantifier exchange. The weak
  terminal status is described as promoted only modulo the six-postulate minimal
  closure package, while the strong terminal theorem and Clay continuum
  Yang-Mills claim remain false. The four named remaining obligations are
  B0.1 `Im` reflection, B0.3 `WeakBG`, BW time-slice, and DR/Doplicher-Roberts;
  the minimal package also tracks `cStarCompletion` and the
  pointwise-to-uniform mass-gap quantifier exchange. The DASHI depth-recursion
  contraction route is recorded only as a candidate proof strategy, not an
  accepted theorem or terminal promotion.

- update the terminal proof-landscape docs without promotion:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md` now name four active
  Yang-Mills/mass-gap lineages as intake or claimed/preprint material:
  Odusanya/Balaban RG, Agawa holonomy non-local RG, the dissolution or
  recontextualisation campaign, and DASHI pro-object finite-depth mass-gap
  receipts. The docs also add the candidate disproof/obstruction queue:
  Gribov-copy obstruction, IR slavery, and massless-gluon/scaling objections.
  The Agawa-to-DASHI mapping is recorded only as a provisional vocabulary map
  from holonomy/non-local RG variables into B0.2 holonomy, depth/refinement,
  operator-norm defect, and continuum-gate targets. The pro-object theorem is
  described as already inhabited only per depth; uniform lower bound and
  continuum promotion remain external Gate 3 obligations. No Clay acceptance,
  accepted theorem, or DASHI continuum mass-gap proof is claimed.

- sync the docs to the three-gate terminal formalism:
  `TODO.md`, `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md` now distinguish the official
  Clay authority gate, external claimed-proof/alternative-intake gate, and
  DASHI-local receipt gate. Clay's Yang-Mills status remains unsolved as of
  `2026-05-18`; Odusanya/`yangmills.dev` is a separate claimed proof series;
  any Zenodo dissolution/recontextualisation record is an alternative intake
  artifact, not a Clay or DASHI theorem. A finite-depth DASHI mass-gap receipt
  may promote only as a bounded local receipt while the continuum Clay problem
  remains open. Cosmological-constant sequestering v2 may reduce local `c1`,
  but still needs compact-universe, shift-symmetry, and `c2/c3` inputs. The
  Yukawa ratio-form may promote only under MatterPrimeLane/FN/Frobenius
  hypotheses; the Higgs vev remains an irreducible adapter input.

- add Cubical and the FRACDASH valuation bridge intake:
  `cubical` is now present as a submodule and included as an optional Agda
  search path without adding a global `--cubical` flag.  The new
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FractranPrimeLaneValuationReceiptSurface.agda`
  records Monster-order p-adic valuations as a 15-lane prime-exponent vector,
  identifies `min(v_p(|M|),3)` as a FRACDASH/FRACTRAN-style projection rather
  than a DHR computation, and wires that receipt into the prime-lane gauge
  blocker while leaving `laneDimension` open.

- add the missing-primitive intake layer without theorem promotion:
  `DASHI/Foundations/RealAnalysisAxioms.agda` now provides the explicit
  postulated real-analysis authority interface for reals, normed/Banach spaces,
  bounded linear operators, operator norm, unitary operators, Cauchy convergence,
  and geometric-series convergence. `FlatFormalDiskHolonomySurface.agda`
  consumes this only as an authority adapter; it does not construct a
  non-postulated holonomy, Stokes, or path-independence proof.  The local
  DCHoTT shim now imports the bundled `Im` and `FormalDisk` names and
  `TransportSmoothFormalDiskSurface.agda` records the DASHI-side depth-0/depth-1
  Im-modal equality bridge, FormalDisk/Im-fibre roundtrips, and reverse-lift
  roundtrips when explicit imported-disk lift data is supplied; full DCHoTT
  path reflection and equivalence remain open. The B0.1 Im-fibre bridge now
  fixes the pro-object parameter explicitly so the socket typechecks without
  hidden metas.  `SO31FirstProlongationZero.agda`
  adds the local abstract-index proof that the SO(3,1) first prolongation
  vanishes, and B0.3 now carries that evidence while Wellen/G-structure and
  Levi-Civita promotion remain blocked.  `QuotientSetoidSurface.agda` adds a
  non-cubical setoid quotient surface used by the AQFT quotient layer; no HIT,
  C*-completion, GNS, or AQFT promotion follows.  DHR surfaces now include
  localised endomorphism, transportability, intertwiner, statistics-operator,
  and Doplicher-Roberts authority sockets while `laneDimension` remains the
  deep Standard Model blocker.  Adapter/stress-energy surfaces now include
  no-natural-state/no-preferred-vacuum primitive witnesses and Wald
  `c1/c2/c3` ambiguity interfaces, still non-promoting.
  A second audit added an authority-backed B0.2 holonomy theorem socket, a
  local Nat-valued telescoping/discrete-Stokes receipt, a one-way DASHI
  formal-disk to imported DCHoTT depth-zero formal-disk map,
  cleaned B0.3's blocker list after the local SO(3,1) proof, marked AQFT
  transport-equivalence/setoid quotient laws as inhabited by the setoid
  surface, isolated the DHR prime-lane blocker to `laneDimension`, and
  reclassified adapter/stress-energy stale blockers as authority-token or
  coefficient-selection boundaries.

- strengthen Worker 6 adapter, Wald, and terminal gate receipts without
  promotion:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AdapterIrreducibilityNoGoIndex.agda` now adds explicit
  non-promoting receipt surfaces for no-natural-state-selection and
  no-preferred-vacuum, linking theorem targets, primitive witnesses, and
  constructorless authority tokens. `DASHI/Physics/QFT/StressEnergyBridgeReceiptSurface.agda`
  now records `c1/c2/c3` as Wald adapter parameters for local curvature
  ambiguity, with no coefficient values or prescription selected.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now records a
  weak terminal open-status grammar gated by B0, AQFT, DHR, `laneDimension`,
  stress-energy/Wald authority, and adapter no-go authority. The weak terminal
  status is promoted only modulo those gates; `terminalClaimPromoted`, strong
  terminal closure, and Clay continuum promotion remain false.
  Gates 7-9 extend this pass with complete target argument surfaces for the
  no-natural-state corner-embedding recipe and no-preferred-vacuum Killing-
  vector/frequency-splitting recipe, plus a Yukawa-sector grammar separating
  partial representation-pattern derivation from irreducible absolute-scale
  input. `TerminalCompletenessGrammarSurface.agda` now also records a
  physical-accessibility four-way finite classifier. These are inhabited
  receipt/grammar surfaces only; the upstream theorem authorities remain open.

- make the terminal completeness grammar constructively inspectable without
  promotion:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TerminalCompletenessGrammarSurface.agda` now defines
  explicit evidence families for derived carrier, adapter-boundary, external
  reference, open spectral/calibration, and non-promoted completeness
  classifications, plus a finite evidence-sum classifier for the current
  statement grammar. It also records derivation-tree availability for the
  constructible grammar rows and proves the terminal TOE row has no derivation
  tree while the terminal promotion authority token remains constructorless.
  A second audit now packages these as inhabited current-finite-grammar
  classifier and derivation-availability receipts, while leaving generalized
  terminal grammar semantics and TOE promotion blocked.
  `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md` and `TODO.md` now state this as
  finite grammar evidence only; no GRQFT, Standard Model, terminal completeness,
  or TOE promotion follows.

- add the remaining-formalism target surfaces:
  `DASHI/Geometry/TransportSmoothFormalDiskSurface.agda` records the B0.1
  analytic surface for transport-smooth functions, clopen-ball sites,
  sheaf-style locality/gluing/product targets, first-order formal-disk
  comparison, and tangent/graded-piece binding. `FlatFormalDiskHolonomySurface.agda`
  records B0.2 normed-fibre, operator-norm defect, geometric decay,
  finite-area loop, nonabelian-Stokes, holonomy, path-independence, and
  flat-connection targets. `GStructureLeviCivitaBindingSurface.agda` records
  B0.3 frame/metric tower, SO(3,1) reduction, first-prolongation-zero, and
  Wellen/Levi-Civita sockets. `AQFTCarrierAlgebraQuotientSurface.agda` now
  includes quotient operation labels, transport-equivalence laws, colimit
  universality, isotony/G6/descent targets, and Cauchy/time-slice intermediate
  targets. `MatterRepresentationReceiptSurface.agda`,
  `StressEnergyBridgeReceiptSurface.agda`, and
  `TerminalCompletenessGrammarSurface.agda` record the matter, stress-energy,
  Wald ambiguity, and terminal statement-classification grammar sockets.
  These surfaces are non-promoting: B0, AQFT time-slice, matter/stress-energy,
  GRQFT, Standard Model, and TOE claims remain uninhabited and the terminal
  gate remains explicitly false.

- add terminal open-problem status intake:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BalabanRGMassGapReceiptSurface.agda` records the
  external Odusanya/Balaban Yang-Mills chain as a non-promoting cited-proof
  intake: lattice transfer-matrix gap, Balaban master induction, OS
  reconstruction, compact-simple-group extension, and machine-verification
  authority are named as stages, but no local proof or terminal promotion is
  supplied.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TerminalOpenProblemStatusSurface.agda` records the
  external Odusanya/`yangmills.dev` 2026 Yang-Mills mass-gap claim as a
  separate Balaban-RG/machine-verification proof series under review; Clay
  remains officially unsolved as of `2026-05-18`, and no DASHI continuum
  theorem promotion follows. It also records cosmological-constant strategies
  as open targets: sequestering v2 may reduce local `c1`, but compact-universe,
  shift-symmetry, and `c2/c3` inputs remain required. `G_DHR = G_SM` is an open
  localized-endomorphism/statistics-operator/Doplicher-Roberts/prime-lane
  automorphism computation, Born/coupling no-go arguments as proof strategies
  not formalized irreducibility theorems, Gleason/Busch and beta-function
  matter-representation boundaries, and strong CP/Peccei-Quinn as an Adapter4
  sub-problem target with theta-vacuum, axion-window, and K-theory character
  surfaces. `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now consumes this status
  surface while keeping `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.

- add proof-grade DASHI-side B0.1 pro-object semantics:
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProObjectSemantics.agda` constructs the internal compatible
  refinement-family semantics for `ProObjectCarrier`: constructed pro-object
  points, depth projections, refinement coherence, pointwise equality,
  depthwise ball/agreement laws, the depth-zero formal-disk relation, and a
  non-promoting B0.1 receipt. This upgrades only the DASHI-side compatible
  family construction surface. It does not prove transport-smooth sheaves,
  real-valued ultrametric completion, compact profinite embedding, first-order
  approximation, formal-disk-to-DCHoTT equivalence, DCHoTT formal-D-space or
  manifold structure, B0.2 flatness, B0.3 G-structure promotion,
  torsion-freeness, B0 geometric emergence, Levi-Civita uniqueness, GRQFT, or
  TOE closure.

- clarify K3 / duality / arithmetic-cohomology roadmap boundaries:
  `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md` and `TODO.md` now state K3 geometry,
  Seiberg-Witten/S-duality/Langlands, arithmetic cohomology, and
  supersingular-K3/Frobenius/primes-to-gauge comparisons as external/reference
  targets unless separately formalized in DASHI Agda.  The wording explicitly
  avoids treating seven-step explanatory chains as internally proved DASHI
  results and blocks promotion to Standard Model group construction,
  hypercharge embedding, anomaly cancellation, S-dual QFT, Langlands theorem,
  GRQFT receipt, or TOE closure.

## 2026-05-17

- add the next professor-facing unification target surfaces:
  `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTBridgeObligationIndex.agda` now includes a
  tangent-category target layer for the pro-object carrier; the new
  `DASHI/Geometry/CharacteristicClassReceiptSurface.agda` records AHSS,
  Chern-Weil, Pontryagin, and Euler targets; the new QFT surfaces
  `ModularTheoryReceiptSurface.agda`, `DHRGaugeReceiptSurface.agda`, and
  `OPEConformalBootstrapReceiptSurface.agda` record modular theory,
  Haag/DHR/gauge reconstruction, and OPE/bootstrap/mass-gap targets. These are
  target-only roadmap receipts: no tangent equivalence, characteristic-class
  theorem, modular theorem, DHR reconstruction, Standard Model match, OPE
  solution, mass-gap theorem, GRQFT receipt, or TOE promotion is constructed.

- add K-theory / Novikov target receipt surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/KTheoryNovikovReceiptSurface.agda` records
  non-promoting target surfaces for the Novikov/assembly map, K-theory charge
  classification through a future DHR adapter, six-term exact sequence /
  bulk-boundary receipt, and the B0/AQFT/DHR/K-theory/mass-gap/Lambda dependency
  graph. `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md` and `TODO.md` now include the
  same boundary: no assembly map, charge classification, exact-sequence proof,
  mass-gap solution, Lambda calibration, GRQFT receipt, Standard Model claim, or
  TOE promotion is constructed.
  The same surface now adds target-only K-theoretic time-slice, Baum-Connes,
  algebraic K-theory tower, anomaly-cancellation, and Standard Model compact
  group/global-form sockets without proving the corresponding assembly,
  K-theory, anomaly, or Standard Model matching results.

- add the Chen/Moonshine/VOA/SUSY/GNS/prime-lane gauge roadmap layer:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MoonshinePrimeLaneReceiptSurface.agda` records the 15
  tracked Monster/supersingular prime lanes, Chen-prime observation targets,
  genus-zero/Hauptmodul targets, and McKay-Thompson lane-amplitude target.
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/VOAMoonshineBridgeReceiptSurface.agda` records VOA,
  Moonshine VOA, chiral CFT net, holomorphic factorisation, K3
  compactification, and 4D effective-theory targets.
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/WittenIndexSUSYBoundarySurface.agda` records
  spin-structure, SUSY, Witten-index, observed-SM/SUSY-status, and
  cosmological-constant implication targets.
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/GNSFellRepresentationSurface.agda` records the GNS
  universal property, state-observable duality, folia, representation-class
  superselection, Fell topology, and KMS-family proximity targets.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PrimeLaneGaugeAssignmentReceiptSurface.agda` records
  the 15-lane product, Chen pairing/cluster, DHR-computation-vs-adapter,
  residual `H`, exact Standard Model match, and nontrivial residual branches.
  These are target-only surfaces: no Chen theorem, Moonshine theorem,
  VOA-to-AQFT theorem, K3 oxidation, SUSY result, GNS representation,
  Fell-topology theorem, prime-lane gauge assignment, Standard Model match,
  GRQFT receipt, or TOE claim is promoted.

- add professor-facing GRQFT roadmap caveats:
  `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ClaimLedger.md`, `TODO.md`, and this changelog
  now state the complete-unification-paper roadmap as a condensed/profinite-style
  comparison programme rather than a completed theorem. The added wording keeps
  B0 formal-disk equivalence, AQFT Cauchy/time-slice evolution, adapter
  irreducibility no-go proofs, and terminal GRQFT composition as future typed
  obligations; no new Paper 1, GRQFT, Standard Model, or TOE promotion claim is
  introduced.

- add the first B0.1 compatible-family surface:
  `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTBridgeObligationIndex.agda` now records
  `ProCompatibleFamily` and `ProLimitProjectionSurface` for the DASHI-side
  inverse-limit cone over a `ProObjectCarrier`, plus `ProObjectPoint`, `Im`,
  `FormallyClose`, and `FormalDisk` for the depth-zero formal-disk scaffold.
  The helpers `limitAsCompatibleFamily` and `limitAsProObjectPoint` turn a
  projected pro-limit point into a compatible refinement-depth family. The same
  module now records `WaveCoherentFlatFormalDiskSurface` as the B0.2
  flat-in-the-limit target. The same module now records
  `RefinementStableGStructureSurface` as the B0.3 target: a depth-indexed
  frame bundle, compatible metric tower, Lorentz signature adapter, pro-frame
  limit, and DCHoTT G-structure reduction witness remain required before any
  refinement-to-G-structure claim can promote. These narrow the B0.1/B0.2/B0.3
  construction targets
  without constructing a DCHoTT formal D-space, manifold, G-structure,
  Levi-Civita adapter, or B0 proof.

- fail-close DYTurbo `xs_qt` strict-log artifacts:
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_t43_strict_log.py` now records `jet_mode` as part of the
  strict-log provider metadata and keeps all DYTurbo `xs_qt` outputs
  diagnostic-only. Even if a run supplies native-looking metadata, this script
  cannot set `promotes = true`; strict-log promotion requires a distinct native
  event-level `phi*` provider with the exact CMS at-least-one-jet contract.

- add the AQFT carrier-algebra quotient target surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/AQFTCarrierAlgebraQuotientSurface.agda` records the next
  typed construction target `A(O)` as promoted receipts over the carrier
  restricted to a region, quotiented by transport equivalence, with a separate
  quotient-relation target. The depth-filtered surface now records directed
  depth obligations for `A_d(O)` and `colim_d A_d(O)` and separates algebraic
  colimit operations from the later C*-completion/representation target. The
  surface is exported through `DASHI/Everything.agda` and wired into
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary` as a non-promoting dependency. Restricted
  carriers, quotient operations, directed colimits, and C*-algebra structure are
  still open. The same module now records `CauchyEvolutionReceiptTarget` and
  `TimeSliceTheoremSurface` as the Paper 3a time-slice/domain-of-dependence
  theorem target: carrier data on a Cauchy surface must determine the target
  region before AQFT promotion is possible.

- add the adapter irreducibility no-go index:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AdapterIrreducibilityNoGoIndex.agda` records the four
  empirical adapter no-go theorem targets: metric signature, Born state,
  vacuum selection, and coupling constants. It is wired into
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary` and remains non-promoting: no
  irreducibility proof, GUT boundary proof, Standard Model construction,
  GRQFT receipt, or TOE claim is constructed.

- add proof-ready adapter no-go witness surfaces:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AdapterIrreducibilityNoGoIndex.agda` now records
  countermodel witness targets for each adapter no-go lane: frame/signature
  reduction with the contractible pro-object caveat, Bloch-ball or simple
  matrix-state Born/state witness, curved-background vacuum witness with
  Poincare/spectrum dependencies, and gauge-normalisation coupling witness with
  the GUT receipt boundary. Each witness remains `proofReady = false` and
  `noGoProved = false`; no GRQFT, Standard Model, GUT, or TOE promotion is
  constructed.

- sharpen the terminal GRQFT open-obligation wording:
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary` now records the mass gap as an open
  spectral property of the composed Yang-Mills AQFT object and updates the
  cosmological constant status to the Adapter2-times-Adapter4
  vacuum/renormalisation calibration mismatch with the 120-order discrepancy
  explicitly named. It also now exposes the B0 bridge blockers, B0.2 flat-disk
  obligations, B0.3 G-structure obligations, AQFT typed-net, quotient, depth,
  and time-slice obligations, adapter no-go obligations including the GUT boundary, and
  the W5/GRQFT request-pack authority requirements before any terminal claim can
  promote.

- add Monster and Monster-LILA as external artifact submodules:
  `monster` is now recognized as the existing pinned
  `meta-introspector/monster` submodule, and `Monster-LILA` has been added as a
  pinned `meta-introspector/Monster-LILA` submodule. `Docs/MonsterAndLILAExternalArtifactIntake.md`
  records both as external experimental/reference artifacts only, with AGPL /
  commercial-license cautions and no DASHI theorem, Paper 1, DCHoTT/AQFT/GRQFT,
  or LHC-provider promotion.

- add post-submission DCHoTT/AQFT scaffold surfaces:
  `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTBridgeObligationIndex.agda` decomposes B0 into the
  four open bridge obligations `carrierToDSpace`, `waveCoherentToFlat`,
  `refinementToGStr`, and `gStrToLeviCivita`, while keeping B0 unproved and
  constructorless for promotion authority. `DASHI/Physics/QFT/AQFTTypedNetSurface.agda`
  adds a typed region/local-algebra interface for isotony, causality,
  time-slice, and descent without constructing a C*-algebra, GNS state, Born
  rule adapter, vacuum, interacting QFT, Standard Model, or GRQFT receipt.
  Both modules are exported through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.

- complete the Paper 1 external bridge pack:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now add the
  §2 B0--B5 bridge layer between the background and derivation spine. The new
  text binds DCHoTT geometry, Haag-Kastler/AQFT, interacting-QFT boundaries,
  compression admissibility, and honest-frontier obligations to the
  corresponding repo receipts without promoting B0, non-flat Levi-Civita, GR,
  interacting QFT, Standard Model, or GRQFT closure. §11 now cites the
  operational TRBD decomposition surface and native Z+jet/event-level-`phi*`
  provider blocker; §12 adds the MDL non-increase law from the compression
  admissibility receipt; §14 and the receipt index now include DCHoTT/AQFT/GRQFT
  rows. `ClaimLedger.md`, `TODO.md`, and `Paper1_References.bib` were synced
  with the new bridge wording and references.

- polish Paper 1 positioning around carrier geometry:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now present the constructive ultrametric
  carrier geometry as the mathematical thesis while keeping closure semantics
  as certification infrastructure. The target-equation block is renamed to
  target obligation surfaces, the opening replaces framework/lane posture with
  carrier-geometry and bounded empirical-receipt wording, and the conclusion
  now ends on staged derivation surfaces rather than a governance-centered
  frontier claim.

- tighten Paper 1 Section 5 application prose:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now compress the G2/G3/G6/E8 application
  table, replace remaining "Paper 1 may" status narration with direct
  positive-result and open-obstruction statements, and make the G2 subsection
  construction-first around directed plaquette neighborhoods.

- record the Drell-Yan t43 provider audit:
  `Docs/DYLaneProviderAudit.md` now states the active HEPData `t43/t44`
  contract as a native `phi*` `50-76 / 76-106` ratio with at least one jet
  required. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DrellYanLogLinearShapeLawReceipt.agda`
  adds `DYLaneProviderAuditReceipt` and updates the strict-log diagnostic
  summary so the current blocker is a missing native-`phi*`, exact-jet
  provider. Existing DYTurbo `xs_qt` outputs remain diagnostic and
  non-promoting; the next promotable route is Rivet `CMS_2022_I2079374` on a
  Z+jet generator or a DYTurbo native-`phi*` plus exact-jet implementation.

- add the compressed GR/QFT import roadmap:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExternalFormalImportRoadmapReceipt.agda` records
  DCHoTT-Agda, Haag-Kastler/AQFT-net, and Schreiber cohesive HoTT as external
  import candidates for compressing the metric-adapter, QFT-carrier, and
  GRQFT ambient-framework timeline. `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`
  captures the dependency-intake, import-shim, DCHoTT bridge, AQFT-net receipt,
  and GRQFT consumer-staging plan. The receipt is explicitly non-promoting:
  no external theorem is currently imported into a DASHI adapter. A follow-up
  local-overlap audit now records that DASHI already has flat Levi-Civita,
  GR/QFT consumer-obligation, and adapter-boundary surfaces in repo. The
  DCHoTT dependency has since been cloned locally at
  `ca8c755af0b26f8f50c5a60d3b7f9384a26f5d0e`; `dashi-agda.agda-lib` includes
  `DCHoTT-Agda`; and `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTImportShim.agda` typechecks against
  the actual flat DCHoTT modules (`Manifolds`, `FormalDiskBundle`,
  `G-structure`). `DASHI/Geometry/LeviCivitaBridge.agda` now typechecks a
  non-promoting bridge against the actual exported `G-structures` socket,
  links the existing flat `GRConcreteLeviCivita` prerequisite and downstream
  `DiscreteEinsteinTensorCandidate` diagnostic, and records B0 geometric
  emergence as the first open obligation. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AQFTNetReceipt.agda` now records the
  Haag-Kastler stack contract as a stdlib-only receipt: locally covariant AQFT
  as a point of the HK 2-functor, isotony, causality, time-slice, descent, and
  the Klein-Gordon witness surface. `KleinGordonAQFTReceipt.agda` now records
  the cited Theorem 4.41 free-field stack witness, and
  `InteractingQFTBoundaryReceipt.agda` records constructive interacting local
  algebra nets, renormalisation, and coupling calibration as open boundary
  obligations. Non-flat Levi-Civita import, concrete AQFT algebra-net carriers,
  GNS/vacuum selection, Born rule derivation, interacting QFT construction,
  proof-grade B0, and the cohesive bridge theorem remain absent.

- reorder the Paper 1 opening around reader orientation:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now open with the abstract and concise
  introduction before the target field equations, core carrier grammar, and
  derivation map. The carrier tuple remains early but no longer appears as the
  first object after the title, and the target/core/map blocks stay unnumbered
  so the existing theorem section numbers are preserved. Theorem 10.2's
  projection-defect display now uses explicit section application instead of a
  fragile composed-map display.

- compress Paper 1 framework narration after derivation pass:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now tighten Section 5, QFT/GR/measurement
  wording, empirical contact, compression, closure frontier, reproducibility,
  glossary, Appendix C, and conclusions. The pass deletes the redundant
  certification-flow table, replaces "forbidden promotion" with "unsupported
  stronger claim", compresses the sibling experiment inventory into a
  diagnostic origins paragraph, removes repo-local references from the main
  `\nocite` set, and adds a standard filtered/graded algebra reference.

- tighten Paper 1 mathematical prose voice:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now replace the remaining
  ontology-narration phrasing in the Introduction, Background, Section 4,
  Compression section, and Conclusions with direct object/property/consequence
  statements. The pass keeps the theorem topology unchanged while making the
  carrier, projection-defect, filtration, lane-action, and UFT descriptions
  read as mathematical exposition rather than framework self-description.

- harden Paper 1 namespace, figure, and citation infrastructure:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now clarify that G2/G3/G6 are
  DASHI-native derivation-lane labels rather than claims about same-named
  external mathematical objects. The manuscript adds glossary and symbol-index
  appendices, shortens the non-claim section, splits the old origin diagnostics
  plate into three larger figure groups, and expands `Paper1_References.bib`
  with strategic anchors for ultrametrics/p-adics, gauge/lattice geometry, GR,
  QFT/operator scaffolding, root systems, dependent type theory, MDL, and
  Drell-Yan.

- add the Marx algebraic derivative receipt:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MarxDialecticalDerivativeReceipt.agda` records Marx's
  finite-difference route as a non-promoting DASHI receipt: ordinary
  displacement, algebraic factorization witness, lawful collapse, and promoted
  operational symbol. The receipt now also names the admissible algebraic
  factorization class and theorem-shaped power/linearity/product/chain rule
  receipts. `Docs/MarxDialecticalDerivativeReceipt.md` ties the bridge to local
  PDF anchors from Marx's mathematical manuscripts and to the repo's existing
  fascistic/antifascistic boundary vocabulary: premature projection is blocked
  collapse, while cancellation after factorization is witness-preserving
  contraction. No modern-analysis, differential-geometry, political/economic,
  or complete calculus-tower promotion is constructed.

- add the calculus completion pack:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CalculusCompletionPack.agda` records the next
  post-Marx calculus layers as bounded DASHI surfaces: analytic completion,
  topology, Banach/Hilbert carriers, measure/integration, and
  infinite-dimensional Frechet-style calculus. `Docs/CalculusCompletionPack.md`
  documents the same roadmap and keeps the Python/Lean/Agda workflow split out
  of Agda. The pack is an adapter/roadmap receipt only; it does not claim a
  completed proof of standard analysis.

- move long Agda identifiers out of Paper 1 explanatory prose:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now use human-readable receipt labels in
  the body (for example, "tracked G6 commuting theorem" and "compression
  admissibility receipt") and keep exact Agda names/modules in a compact
  reproducibility receipt index. This preserves auditability while reducing
  repo-report tone and TeX line pressure in the main mathematical exposition.

- add the Paper 1 origins figure pack:
  a six-lane read-only audit of sibling visual and experiment folders selected
  dashifine ultrametric stills, dashitest tree-diffusion plots, FRACDASH
  branch-density projection, and adaptive-refinement imagery from the separate
  `dashiRTX` physically-based raytracing / MDL sparse light-transport
  prototype as diagnostic-only visual provenance. Stable copies now live under
  `Docs/Images/paper1-origin-figures/`, the LaTeX-facing composite plate lives
  under `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/figures/paper1-origin-figures/`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/FigureCandidateManifest.md` records paths,
  digests, roles, and non-promotion boundaries. Paper 1's origins appendix now
  includes the plate without changing the main derivation topology.

- sync Paper 1's submission-facing and stale adapter surfaces:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now use a
  stronger derivation-program title, a single-paragraph journal-shaped
  abstract, and explicit keywords. The early derivation map now distinguishes
  G2 schema adoption from Maxwell field-equation closure, and sharpens QFT,
  GR, measurement, and sector-splitting adapter obligations without adding new
  targets. `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md` records the same sync note:
  the newer G2 SFGC schema-extension receipt clears schema adoption for current
  core-facing consumers, while Maxwell still needs schema-to-Maxwell binding,
  exterior derivative/nilpotency, Hodge/current/source laws, sector/action
  restriction, covariance, units, and convention authority.

- add the DYTurbo FPC provider-card harness:
  `scripts/generate_dyturbo_cms_cards.py` now emits CMS-SMP-20-003 t43
  numerator/denominator FPC smoke cards plus a manifest that records the local
  DYTurbo 1.4.2 semantics. The local source exposes FPC through
  `doFPC/qtfpc/FPCquad/intDimFPC`, not a literal `recoil = 2` card key, and
  activates the FPC term only when `fixedorder_only = true`. The generated
  cards are deliberately non-promoting because stock DYTurbo cards cannot
  express the exact CMS leading/subleading lepton pT cuts (`25/20 GeV`); exact
  strict-log closure still requires a compiled `user_cuts.h` path or an
  external fiducial provider artifact.

- add UI-facing progress for long DYTurbo jobs:
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_with_progress.py` wraps a DYTurbo card run and emits
  JSONL `start`, `heartbeat`, parsed bin-row `progress`, and terminal
  `complete`/`failed` events with elapsed time, estimated completion when
  possible, and output-candidate paths. This keeps FPC/provider runs visible
  during silent pcubature or Vegas phases.

- add provider metadata to the DYTurbo strict-log consumer:
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_t43_strict_log.py` now records provider treatment, cut
  mode, FPC status/artifact, qT-to-phi* mapping, and normalization treatment in
  blocked and computed artifacts, so future FPC strict-log outputs carry their
  comparison contract explicitly.

## 2026-05-16

- add the narrow Paper 1 integrator derivation pass:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now include four targeted inserts without
  changing the manuscript architecture: a root-shell lemma reframing E8/LILA
  as bounded local geometry, a Lorentz bridge from bounded traversal to
  invariant cone targets, a plaquette-ordering theorem deriving the
  Yang-Mills curvature commutator term, and a projection-incompatibility
  theorem explaining residual fibre growth for uncertainty/interference
  targets. The pass keeps all field equations and Lorentz/E8 readings as
  adapter targets unless their receipt surfaces are inhabited.

- address the full-PDF reviewer feedback pass:
  the opening hierarchy now precedes the target equations, a compact
  frontier-at-a-glance table appears after the abstract, compression semantics
  now includes the formal admissibility theorem inhabited by
  `canonicalCompressionAdmissibilityReceipt`, empirical contact now names TRBD
  as a reusable typed residual-basis method, the unreadable narrative diagram
  is replaced in the PDF body by a compact table, and bibliography placeholders
  are replaced with concrete Agda, CMS/HEPData, CSS, and EMST references.

- reorder Paper 1 around the page-early physics equations:
  the target-equation material now appears before the abstract in
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex`, including the transport-defect,
  gauge-curvature, Yang-Mills/Maxwell, QFT/operator, and GR source equations
  plus a table mapping Einstein-side terms to DASHI structural obligations.
  The origins/video provenance section now follows the formal derivation
  sections, and the public narrative diagram has been moved out of the
  introduction.

- replace the physics-facing target table with derivation sections:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now put target equations and obligations
  in the body and add math-first sections for locality/time/causality from
  finite-support traversal, gauge transport from local sections, QFT/operator
  surfaces from filtered quotients, curvature/GR from transport defect, and
  measurement/interference/entropy/sector splitting from projection-defect.
  The GR target equation, gauge curvature equations, and operator/QFT target
  equations are now visible before empirical contact, while all physical
  closures remain residual obligations rather than promoted results.

- add the Paper 1 derivation spine:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and
  `Paper1_Manuscript.tex` now derive the core carrier route in
  Definition/Lemma/Proof form: primitive ternary state, traversal,
  voxel/hypercube cell, trie ultrametric, tracked `FactorVec` valuation,
  projection-defect structure, and filtration/associated-graded descent. The
  TeX surface now includes theorem-style environments via `amsthm`/`amssymb`
  and builds to the updated PDF.

- recast construction and physics sections around the derivation:
  G2/G3/G6/E8-LILA are now presented as applications of the derivation spine
  rather than as module inventory, and a new physics-facing emergence-target
  bridge maps locality, time/causality, measurement, uncertainty/interference,
  gauge transport, QFT/operator filtrations, and curvature/GR to explicit
  theorem obligations. The closure/frontier language remains fail-closed but
  is less dominant in the paper flow.

- integrate sibling video evidence inventory into the origins section:
  Paper 1 now cites the SIB-R1 boundary in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SiblingEvidenceInventory.agda` and the concrete
  `Docs/SiblingVideoEvidenceInventory.md` inventory, distinguishing dashifine
  GIF/frame diagnostics, dashitest codec/Vulkan/live-sheet/MP4 smoke artifacts,
  and tree-diffusion metrics from DASHI-local theorem authority. The text keeps
  the evidence diagnostic-only until a local receipt binds trace source,
  observation map, metric, admissibility law, rerun command, digests, and
  promotion boundary.

## 2026-05-15

- add first-page formalism and origins narrative to Paper 1:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now open with a compact core-formalism box
  covering the carrier tuple, ternary coordinate, projection-defect split,
  ultrametric refinement, filtered operator surfaces, tracked lane actions, and
  UFT/motif compression as manuscript grammar rather than a universal physics
  law. A new section, `From Ternary Traversal to Carrier Geometry`, records the
  disciplined origin path from trits/Base369 and dialectical unresolvedness
  through cube/voxel traversal, video-like continuity diagnostics, UFT tries,
  FactorVec lanes, and filtration/operator closure. `EarlyOriginThreadReference.md`,
  `SourceLedger.md`, `ClaimLedger.md`, and `OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now
  preserve the source-thread handles and non-promotion boundaries.

- rebalance the Paper 1 manuscript around the mathematical carrier:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and
  `Paper1_Manuscript.tex` now foreground the ultrametric carrier,
  projection-defect split, UFT/compression semantics, filtration, lane action,
  and local mathematical surfaces before the obstruction frontier. The
  obstruction table is preserved as a later certification layer, so typed
  governance remains the enforcement architecture without dominating the
  reader's first encounter with the physics-unification substrate.

- assemble the Paper 1 manuscript and TeX/PDF surface:
  six manuscript workers drafted the lead narrative, formal core, empirical
  contact, obstruction frontier, provenance/related-work, and TeX/PDF assembly
  lanes under `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/sections/21_*` through
  `26_*`. The integrated authoring surface is now
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md`, with a direct TeX
  version in `Paper1_Manuscript.tex`, bibliography stubs in
  `Paper1_References.bib`, a vector PDF figure converted from SVG at
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/figures/PublicPaperNarrativeFlow.pdf`, and a
  compiled draft PDF at
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/build/Paper1_Manuscript.pdf`. The manuscript
  foregrounds physics unification as the thesis and typed claim governance as
  the enforcement architecture, while preserving bounded W3 contact, strict
  Drell-Yan failure, W4/W5 authority blockers, G3 quotient blockers, tracked
  G6 scope, local/upstream E8 boundaries, and non-promoting provenance routes.

- add the Paper 1 drafting and reviewer-control workspace:
  `Docs/Paper1DraftSkeleton.md`, `Docs/Paper1InternalFormalMethodsOutline.md`,
  and `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/` now package the fail-closed Paper 1
  manuscript surface. The working folder contains the main manuscript, source
  and claim ledgers, formal-methods positioning, outreach/crosswalk synthesis,
  cross-domain variational-spine boundary, braid-memory current-event boundary,
  and claim-risk audits. This is a docs-only paper workspace: it does not
  construct authority tokens, promote empirical validation, close GR, or expand
  the formal theorem inventory beyond named receipts and non-promoting
  theorem-target boundaries.

- add the 15SSP scalarization and TOE-bridge boundary layer:
  `Ontology/GodelScalarization.agda` defines the FactorVec Gödel scalar, and
  `Ontology/GodelScalarizationTransportDerived.agda` derives the signed
  transport scalar law for the current 15-lane SSP transfer API. The new
  FactorVec closure modules package post-entropy, formal-compression,
  physical-projection, falsifiable-lane, and concrete-prediction receipt
  surfaces. `PostEntropyUniversalityTheorem.agda` and
  `FormalCompressionUniversalityBridge.agda` now also carry explicit
  non-promotion boundary records: the scalarization theorem is closed, while
  global post-entropy universality and physical closure remain witness
  obligations, not TOE promotion.

- attach the first Drell-Yan adjacent-ratio empirical lane receipt:
  `DrellYanAdjacentRatioEmpiricalLaneReceipt.agda` binds the existing W3
  CMS-SMP-20-003 / HEPData `ins2079374` t43/t44 comparison-law receipt to the
  FactorVec falsification-lane surface, recording `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176`
  and `mean pred/data = 0.9941233097`. The receipt explicitly records that the
  stricter `chi2/dof <= 2` lane target is not passed, so this is bounded
  empirical contact rather than strict lane success. `Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md`
  and `Docs/LimitedSMGRPaperReadinessMatrix.md` were updated to preserve that
  boundary.

- add a fail-closed strict Drell-Yan log-covariance diagnostic mode:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py --mode t43-strict-log` now compares predictions
  against t43 ratios using the full t44 covariance propagated to log residuals,
  with no scalar refit and an explicit `chi2/dof <= 2` threshold. The persisted
  artifacts
  `scripts/data/outputs/t43_strict_log_phi_star_ratio_20260515.json` and
  `scripts/data/outputs/t43_strict_log_sigma_dashi_v4_20260515.json` record
  strict failures for the current predictors (`283.4574` and `3180.2117`
  chi2/dof respectively), so this mode is a negative diagnostic, not a promotion
  receipt. The same artifacts now also carry diagnostic decomposition fields:
  diagonal-only log chi2/dof is worse (`326.0905` / `5219.4185`), so
  off-diagonal covariance is not the inflation source; leading inverse-covariance
  modes are not rank-1 dominant (`0.0066` / `0.0126` contribution fractions);
  the residuals are instead mostly captured by the `1, log(phiStar)` subspace
  (`0.8905` / `0.9687` chi2 fractions).

- add a G3 associated-graded projection-interface target:
  `G3AssociatedGradedQuotientSurface.agda` now records
  `G3AssociatedGradedProjectionInterface`, a projection-only API for mapping
  selected prequotient `F_n` pieces into an abstract graded-class surface while
  requiring the projection to respect the candidate modulo-previous relation.
  This is explicitly weaker than constructing `F_n / F_{n-1}`: the accepted
  quotient carrier, accepted equivalence modulo previous filtration, and
  Poincare/Galilei associated-graded isomorphism remain open blockers.

- add the cross-domain variational spine boundary:
  `CrossDomainVariationalSpine.agda` defines the common typed object
  `(X, delta, pi, defect, gate, observation, symmetry)` and records molecular
  PES minima, bonding projection/defect density, resonance MDL projection,
  biological attractors, and Kluver perceptual orbit classes as instances of
  the same theorem target. The canonical boundary explicitly allows only the
  structural/compositional bridge claim; quantitative calibration,
  universality, chemistry/biology/perception empirical prediction receipts, and
  cross-domain recovery equivalences remain missing.

- add corrected Drell-Yan strict-log and brain/fMRI observation targets:
  `DrellYanStrictLogLinearSubspaceReceipt.agda` records the empirical
  refutation of the off-diagonal-inflation and rank-1-eigenmode explanations,
  and the positive diagnosis that sigma_DASHI v4 is dominated by the
  `1, log(phiStar)` residual subspace (`0.9687` chi2 fraction). It also names
  `StrictPassOrthogonalityObligation` and a depth-averaged curvature-kernel
  candidate as the next non-promoting theorem target. Separately,
  `BrainConnectomeFMRIObservationQuotient.agda` refines the perception lane into
  `phase orbit -> neural initialization -> connectome-constrained processing ->
  high-resolution/laminar fMRI readout -> behavioral report`, with missing
  dataset/protocol/metric receipts explicitly listed. The brain/fMRI module now
  also records the concrete brain carrier target `X_brain = (V,E,W,sigma)`,
  the connectome carrier `C = (V,E,W,Lambda)`, ternary neuronal state,
  connectome-constrained threshold transition, MDL processing energy,
  connectome symmetry quotient, processing orbit quotient, inverse observation
  target, and the laminar readout factorization constraint. The bridge target
  now includes pointwise gate-law, MDL-order/descent-soundness, quotient
  equivalence, class-of-state, and symmetry-respecting bridge obligations.

- add the developmental genomic inverse bridge boundary:
  `DevelopmentalGenomicInverseBridge.agda` records the forward generative chain
  `genome -> regulatory activation -> morphogenesis -> neural differentiation
  -> developmental connectome -> mature processing -> observable readout`, and
  the inverse condition-probing chain `DeltaY -> DeltaO -> DeltaT_C -> DeltaC
  -> DeltaM -> DeltaR -> candidate Delta g`. The module packages candidate
  regulatory fibres and ranking by phenotype residual, MDL perturbation,
  pleiotropy, and layer-constraint penalties. It now also adds causal-shape
  taxonomy, CRISPR perturbation classes, layered residual compatibility,
  fibre-refinement, laminar-narrowing, and calibration-fixture slots for HBB,
  CFTR, CCR5-Delta32, PCSK9, LCT enhancer, HOX/SHH, FOXP2, and APOE. It
  explicitly forbids DNA blueprint, one-gene-causes-condition, disease-gene
  validation, and biology/cognition/perception closure claims until dataset,
  calibration, inverse-projection, fixture-ground-truth, fixture-ranking, and
  ranking-validation receipts exist.

- reconcile W9 and G6 stale status surfaces:
  `W9PairTransportBridgeObstruction.agda` and
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now agree with the kill
  matrix that W9 is unblocked only through the MDL termination seam while the
  pressure-equality/Qcore routes remain negative diagnostics. G6 docs now
  distinguish the paper-usable tracked `GL.FactorVec` theorem from the still
  skeleton-only full common-spine section theorem.

## 2026-05-13

- add the W4/W5 public pT-table integral diagnostic:
  `scripts/run_w4w5_hepdata_pt_integral.py` now probes the direct HEPData
  `ins2079374` t1/t3/t21/t22 CSV endpoints, records the CLI 403 / Cloudflare
  failures, and falls back to the CMS public YAML mirror for absolute
  `d sigma / d pT(ll)` tables. The generated
  `scripts/data/outputs/w4w5_hepdata_pt_integral.json` records SHA-256
  digests, source URLs, pT integrals, and ratios for inclusive and
  at-least-one-jet 50-76, 76-106, and 106-170 GeV mass windows. The direct
  pT-table integrals do not match the old `0.8804486068` W5 target, so
  `Docs/W4W5AcceptanceBridgeProviderRequest.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` now record this as a negative, non-promoting
  diagnostic. No W4/W5 authority or gate promotion is claimed.

- add the G3 contraction-carrier fail-closed receipt:
  `G3ContractionCarrier.agda` now checks the selected concrete `P/H/K`
  operator package against the real Schrodinger-scope
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` target and records the exact
  non-promotion boundary. The selected FactorVec endomorphisms, p2
  filtration, and bump-commutation laws do not yet supply the wave-function
  scalar ring, Lie bracket semantics, filtered bracket law, associated-graded
  Galilei identification, or contraction-parameter law needed to inhabit
  `SES.PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType`. No G3 promotion is claimed.

- add the G2 Phase4 prime-lattice coefficient bridge:
  `G2PrimeLatticeCoefficientBridge.agda` now supplies a concrete
  `PrimeLatticeCoefficientLaw Phase4` for the standalone prime lattice and
  proves `δ₁ (δ₀ f) = φ0` by finite normalization over the four Phase4
  constructors. The same module records the fail-closed SFGC bridge boundary:
  `SFGC.GaugeField` is still `ShiftPressurePoint -> Phase4`, and the exact
  first missing interface is a real `PrimeLatticeEdge -> ShiftPressurePoint`
  projection or prime-indexed SFGC link action. No
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField`, Maxwell bridge, or G2 promotion
  is claimed.

- integrate the next-six parallel lane assignment:
  `G3SelectedCarrierInstance.agda` now gives a concrete selected
  `DASHIState` with `Carrier = FactorVec` and p2 bump/projection laws, while
  explicitly preserving the global adapter gap. `G3P2OperatorSurface.agda`
  now carries adapter-indexed `P`, `H`, `K`, commutator, p2 filtration, and IW
  request surfaces, still conditional on the missing global adapter.
  `G2TransverseEdgeAPI.agda` records that the current SFGC surface exposes only
  right edges and names the missing transverse edge, endpoint, and plaquette
  bump-commutation APIs. `G2PlaquetteBumpCommutationLaw.agda` adds the
  conditional signed-boundary, vacuum-flatness, and d²/bump-commutation law
  surface. `GRSelectedNonFlatMetricInstance.agda` adds a selected non-flat
  metric dependency with inverse/trace laws and names
  `missingSelectedChristoffelFromMetricLaw` as the first GR gap. The V2
  external authority packet set is now split into per-gate provider requests.
  No G2, G3, GR, W2/W3/W4/W5, G6, W7, or paper promotion is claimed.

- harden Lane 6 external authority provider packets:
  `Docs/ExternalAuthorityPacketV2.md` now indexes sendable W2, W3, W4, and W5
  provider requests. `Docs/W2ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md`,
  `Docs/W3ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md`,
  `Docs/W4ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md`, and
  `Docs/W5ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md` split the evidence,
  requested authority identity, exact receipt shape, source artifacts, and
  non-promotion caveats by gate. `Docs/ExternalAuthorityPacket.md` now points
  to the V2/per-gate packet set. No Agda gates or external closures are
  changed.

- integrate next-six-lanes follow-up after W9 closure:
  `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now adds
  `G3DASHIStateCarrierFactorVecAdapterRequest`, naming the exact missing
  assumption-free `DASHIState.Carrier -> FactorVec` adapter, p2 bump state,
  factor-vector preservation, p2 exponent, and filtration laws. A new
  `G3P2OperatorSurface.agda` provides a conditional, non-promoting operator
  package parameterized by that adapter, including p2/spatial bump,
  momentum/boost, and commutator-obligation surfaces. `GRNonFlatScalarAlgebraSurface.agda`
  now has `canonicalGRFiniteRCarrierScalarOperations` and an explicit
  conditional non-flat metric dependency surface with metric, inverse law,
  derivative, finite contraction, Christoffel, trace, and Ricci-cancellation
  inputs; `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` consumes this as a request only.
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now records
  `canonicalSFGCNondegeneratePlaquetteCarrierRequest`, making
  `ShiftGaugeFieldGaugeConnection`, independent transverse edges, endpoint
  laws, and plaquette bump-commutation laws the first concrete G2 interface
  gap. `Docs/W4W5AcceptanceBridgeProviderRequest.md` adds the provider-facing
  W4/W5 acceptance bridge packet. No G2, G3, GR, W4/W5, G6, W7, or paper
  promotion is claimed.

- integrate the high-alpha follow-up tranche after W9 closure:
  `W7ClaimGovernanceReceiptRequest.agda` now records the current W7 gate board
  as a non-promoting request: W9 closed, W2/W3/W4/W5 external-required,
  G2/G3/GR internal-pending, and G6 downstream-pending; it does not construct
  W7 or `paperAdmissible`. `G6PrerequisiteIndex.agda` indexes future G6
  prerequisites without importing or manufacturing the missing theorem
  inhabitants. `GRNonFlatScalarAlgebraSurface.agda` now separates selected
  non-flat scalar operations, metric dependency, inverse metric laws,
  Christoffel-from-metric, and six-term Ricci cancellation obligations; first
  missing remains the selected `CarrierScalar` operations. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  now adds a four-term SFGC right-edge two-step signed-boundary surface with
  `δ₁` and `δ₁∘δ₀` normalizer laws, but no transverse plaquette or
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField`. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now records the exact fail-closed `DASHIState.Carrier -> FactorVec` adapter
  blocker after inspecting the real `DASHIState` shape. The paper remains
  blocked at `missingRoadmapGovernance`.

- add the concise external authority packet export:
  `Docs/ExternalAuthorityPacket.md` now indexes the W2/W3/W4/W5 evidence and
  authority gaps without claiming external tokens. It records the W3 frozen
  commit `3205d746...`, chi2/dof `2.1565`, mean pred/data `0.9941`, the
  W4/W5 public `DSIG/DPHISTAR` ratios `t43/Z = 0.048798342138242475`,
  `t45/Z = 0.025440376842598356`, `t45/t43 = 0.5213369087525034`, and the
  missing accepted `A(M,phi*)` bridge / observable-conversion law.

- integrate the post-W9 baseline six-lane dispatch:
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` now includes
  `CurrentRoadmapGovernanceGapReceipt`, decomposing `missingRoadmapGovernance`
  into W2/W3/W4/W5 external gates, G2/G3/GR internal gates, G6 downstream, and
  W7 final claim governance while preserving `paperBlocked
  missingRoadmapGovernance`. `W2W3W4W5ExternalAuthorityPacketSurface.agda`
  records the four external gates in one packet and explicitly keeps internal
  construction unauthorized. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now adds a
  conservative right-edge return plaquette normalizer and local `δ₁∘δ₀` zero
  surface, without claiming a nondegenerate curvature carrier. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now adds `G3CarrierToFactorVecMinimalAdapter` and the p2 exponent-after-bump
  lemma, without supplying a real `DASHIState` projection. `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`
  now records a selected non-flat finite-r scalar-algebra dependency request,
  without promoting non-flat Levi-Civita or Einstein closure.

- reconcile six high-alpha lanes:
  W9 is now formally unblocked through the accepted MDL termination seam route:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` ties `w9KillCondition` to
  `canonicalMDLTerminationSeamW9KillReceipt`, and
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` consumes the same receipt through
  an accepted W9 roadmap status. The paper remains blocked on roadmap
  governance, and no pressure-equality/Qcore claim is added.
  `W2W3ExternalAuthorityFormalClosureRequest.agda` records Option B for W2/W3:
  both lanes are pending external authority receipts and no constructorless
  tokens are fabricated. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now adds an
  `SFGCShiftRightEdge` Phase4 1-form bridge and narrows the G2 blocker to a
  right-edge plaquette/signed-boundary/`δ₁` normalizer. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now adds a fail-closed `G3CarrierToFactorVecExternalInterfaceRequest`.
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now has a typechecked flat Minkowski finite-r
  Levi-Civita closure, explicitly non-promoting for selected non-flat GR.
  `W4W5PhiStarToMassAcceptanceBridgeRequest.agda` and the public-ratio runner
  now record the checked CMS/HEPData/Zenodo links, the CLI HEPData JSON 403, and
  the exact missing `A(M, phi*)` / conversion law without promoting
  `0.5213369087525034` to `0.8804486068`.

- integrate six-lane follow-up worker assignment:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` now includes `mdlTerminationSeamRoute` on
  `W9KillRouteReceipt`, with `canonicalMDLTerminationSeamW9KillReceipt`
  inhabiting `W9KillReceipt` through the existing MDL termination seam
  consumer. The broader canonical blocker row and non-limited roadmap bundle
  are intentionally not promoted yet. `W2W3GovernancePolicyHookRequest.agda`
  now records the exact Option-B ruling: the policy permits evidence classes
  but does not authorize token constructors. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  now packages finite `Phase4` abelian coefficient laws plus a point-link
  `connectionToPointLink1Form` bridge and vacuum-zero law; prime-lattice
  curvature remains open. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now exposes
  `G3DASHIStateP2ProjectionInterface` over the real `DASHIState.Carrier` /
  `carrierValue` accessors. `W4W5PhiStarToMassAcceptanceBridgeRequest.agda`
  records that public CMS/HEPData artifacts do not provide the acceptance law
  needed to identify `0.5213369087525034` with the old `0.8804486068`
  correction surface. `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now has a flat constant
  finite-r prerequisite from `MinkowskiLimitReceipt`, while selected non-flat
  GR remains blocked on scalar algebra and Levi-Civita/Ricci ingredients.

- integrate six-lane implementation tranche without promotion:
  `scripts/run_w4w5_hepdata_public_ratio_integral.py` now emits a bounded
  public HEPData ratio-integral diagnostic and
  `scripts/data/outputs/w4w5_hepdata_public_ratio_integral.json` records the
  current run. The local CSVs support a `DSIG/DPHISTAR` / `DSIG/DPHISTAR`
  ratio-table diagnostic rather than a `dσ/dM` mass-window integral; computed
  supported ratios are `t43/Z = 0.048798342138242475`,
  `t45/Z = 0.025440376842598356`, and `t45/t43 = 0.5213369087525034`, with no
  W4/W5 promotion. `W4W5PublicHEPDataRatioDiagnostic.agda` now binds those
  three numbers as the public-table diagnostic result and explicitly separates
  `0.5213369087525034` from the older `0.8804486068` PDF-carrier target.
  `BlockerKillConditionsBase.agda` splits neutral kill-state
  vocabulary from the W9 kill matrix so the MDL route request no longer depends
  on the full kill matrix, but no accepted `W9KillRouteReceipt` constructor is
  added. `W2W3GovernancePolicyHookRequest.agda` records that current policy
  does not authorize token-producing hooks. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  now names `missingGaugeFieldAtProjection` and the required
  `connectionTo1Form` / vacuum-real SFGC API. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now names the real `DASHIState` p2 prime-address interface request.
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now includes a
  `GRChristoffelFromMetricSixTermRicciIdentityRequest`. All changes preserve
  the current blocked/non-promoting status.

- integrate hard-core pressure-point round:
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` now includes a typed
  `HardCorePressurePointBundle` for the five active pressure points: W9 MDL
  kill-matrix consumer, G2 oriented-boundary/incidence algebra, G3
  carrier-operator contraction, GR Levi-Civita metric compatibility, and G6
  lane embedding orthogonality. The canonical bundle records all five as
  route-change-required, typed-but-uninhabited, or downstream-gated; the
  computed paper admissibility remains `paperBlocked missingRoadmapGovernance`.
  `TODO.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`
  now record the worker returns and non-promotion boundaries.

- advance W9/G2/G3/GR/G6 pressure surfaces without promotion:
  `W9MDLTerminationSeamRoute.agda` now wires the MDL witness's retarget
  acceptance into the non-promoting consumer, but the kill matrix still lacks
  an accepted `mdlTerminationSeamRoute`. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  adds signed-boundary helper lemmas and a
  `SignedBoundaryIncidenceSummationSurface`, but no SFGC instantiation or
  `d²=0` theorem. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` adds concrete
  carrier-operator/action-law/commutator obligation records.
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` adds explicit metric-compatibility and
  `carrierConnectionIsLeviCivita` pressure surfaces.
  `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton.agda` adds conditional p2 orthogonality
  specialization and an actual embedding dependency index. None of W9, G2,
  G3, GR, G6, W7, the non-limited paper, or full unification is promoted.

- adapt supplied hard-core inhabitants to current Agda interfaces:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` now records a
  `W9MDLTerminationSeamAcceptedRouteRequest`, preserving the blocked state and
  naming the import-cycle boundary that prevents directly consuming the MDL
  seam from the kill matrix. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now adds the
  corrected square boundary/signed-sum surface and a
  `G2SFGCGaugeFieldCurvatureAPIObstruction` rather than constructing a fake
  shift-gauge curvature carrier. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now
  includes a unit smoke carrier inhabiting the local operator obligation
  records while recording the missing p2 prime-address interface. `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`
  now factors the Levi-Civita path through a standard algebra-law obligation
  and explicitly names the six-term Ricci identity cancellation as the next
  selected-metric sub-obligation. All changes are non-promoting.

- sharpen GR/G6 algebraic consequence surfaces:
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now separates the conditional
  `GRFiniteRRicciFromBianchiObligation` / vacuum Ricci-zero surface from the
  Jacobi-to-Bianchi sidecar and explicitly names missing metric contraction,
  trace=4 reduction, curvature-to-Ricci boundary, and stress-energy
  compatibility. `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton.agda` now provides
  conditional `p2EigenvalueDecompositionCommutes` and
  `primeAddressOrthogonalityCommutes` theorem surfaces from explicit
  p2-prime projection, complex Re/Im, primeIndex injectivity, and orthogonal
  projection laws. No GR finite-r closure, vacuum Einstein theorem, G6 section,
  or complete-unification promotion was constructed.

- add G2 vacuum-Hecke eigenvalue reality obstruction:
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now records the attempted
  `vacuumHeckeEigenvaluesReal` lane as a non-promoting obligation. The current
  inspected support has a static `SFGC.vacuumGaugeField`, Hecke compatibility
  scans, and coarse `PHEM.EigenProfile` counters, but no typed `VacuumState`,
  `activeMode`, scalar `heckeEigenvalue`, `imaginaryPart`,
  `zeroImaginaryPart`, `RealEigenvalue`, or `realEigenvalueBridge`. The new
  conditional bridge only states what would be needed before real vacuum Hecke
  eigenvalues could feed a vacuum-flatness route; no such candidate or flatness
  proof is constructed.

- add GR finite-r discrete Bianchi sidecar scope:
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now states the Jacobi-to-Bianchi bridge as an
  obligation over the existing carrier Lie algebra vocabulary, GR first-order
  finite-r surface, Einstein-equation candidate, discrete Einstein tensor
  diagnostic, and CRT connection diagnostic. The canonical sidecar names the
  exact missing finite-r ingredients: base carrier, cell/neighborhood layer,
  derivation carrier, bracket/Jacobi witness, connection or shift law,
  curvature-as-bracket-defect construction, covariant cyclic/exterior Bianchi
  expression, finite-r Bianchi law, curvature contraction boundary, and
  stress-energy compatibility. No vacuum Einstein closure, finite-r GR
  promotion, sourced Einstein law, or GR/QFT promotion was constructed.

- add the W9 MDL termination seam route request:
  `W9MDLTerminationSeamRoute.agda` constructs a real
  `MDLTerminationSeamWitness` from existing receipts: `normalizeAdd`
  one-step canonicalization/idempotence, sum preservation, the
  carry-depth/budget `CancellationPressureLyapunovBridge`, and the
  weighted-support retarget acceptance receipt. The module also defines a
  non-pressure route consumer and records the exact missing theorem-consumer
  route change: add an `mdlTerminationSeamRoute`-style W9 kill-route
  constructor for the accepted non-Qcore MDL seam. This does not construct
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`, a pressure equality, or `W9KillReceipt`.

- sharpen G2 cochain-complex blocker without promoting curvature:
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now records a dedicated
  `G2PrimeLatticeCochainLawObligation` for the attempted `d0`/`d1`/`d² = 0`
  strengthening. `Ontology.GodelLattice` now exposes prime-indexed
  `updateVec15` with `updateVec15-commutes`, and
  `Ontology.Hecke.FactorVecInstances` now proves `primeBumpCommutes`,
  `by-abelian-factorvec`, and `bumpPrimeCommutes`. The inspected `Phase4`
  finite-gauge base still lacks oriented edge endpoints, the corrected signed
  square boundary `+bottom,+right,-top,-left`, `boundaryOfBoundaryZero`, finite
  incidence summation, and a `Phase4` abelian-group normalizer/proof package,
  so `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` adds a typed
  `CorrectedSquareBoundaryCochainSurface` obligation instead of constructing a
  concrete cochain proof or `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField`.
  `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` record the same non-promoting boundary.

- retarget the W9 diagnostic lane to the existing `<=` consumer receipt:
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` now records the
  local `W9WeightedSupportRetargetConsumerReceipt` as the current
  `RetargetConsumerInterface` and
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerAcceptanceReceipt` source for
  `canonicalPairPressureRetargetReceipt`. The accepted predicate is the
  weighted-support bound `weightedMaxPressure <= weightedSupport`, and the
  request pack now asks for an explicit theorem-consumer route change rather
  than another acceptance provider. This remains non-promoting: the W9 kill
  matrix still accepts only the existing pressure-witness equality route or
  weighted cancellation-to-quadratic identification route.

- add W2/W3 governance policy hook request surface:
  `Docs/DASHIGovernanceSelfIssuancePolicy.md` and
  `Docs/W2W3AuthorityGovernanceFork.md` now state that the admissible hook is
  request-only in the current typed state. The new
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/W2W3GovernancePolicyHookRequest.agda` consumes the
  landed self-issuance policy, W2 audit/intake evidence, and W3
  authority-token intake/response evidence while proving
  `tokenProducingHookAuthorizedNow = false`. `DASHI/Everything.agda`,
  `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` index the same boundary. No
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`,
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, W2 promotion receipt, or W3 accepted
  authority receipt is constructed.

- sharpen G2 prime-lattice 2-cell curvature obligations:
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now exposes a conditional
  `PrimeLattice2CellLayer` with prime-lattice 0/1/2-cell carriers, plaquettes,
  discrete 0/1/2-form carriers, exterior derivatives, a typed `d² = 0` law,
  and the shift-gauge-to-1-form / 2-form-to-field-strength maps needed before
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField` can be inhabited. The canonical
  G2 obstruction now names the missing base types and keeps the carrier
  non-promoted. `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` record the same boundary.

- add G2 Maxwell curvature/discrete-equation obstruction surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.agda`,
  `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md`, and `TODO.md` now record the
  inspected finite/static gauge support for a future curvature-to-field-strength
  and discrete Maxwell equation route. The exact first missing field is
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier for SFGC.GaugeField`; after that, the first missing
  lemma is `curvatureToFieldStrengthFromShiftGaugeConnection`. No
  `MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationTheorem` inhabitant is constructed, so G2 remains
  non-promoted.

- add W4-gated finite-r GR Bianchi/matter obligation surface:
  `GRFirstOrderGravityScope.agda` now separates the future
  `GRFiniteRW4BianchiMatterTheoremObligation`, parameterized by an
  `EinsteinEquationCandidate.W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt`, from the
  canonical diagnostic surface that records the receipt is still impossible
  here. The surface orders W4 matter/stress-energy, finite-r Bianchi,
  stress-energy compatibility, and the sourced Einstein law without proving any
  of them. `Docs/GRFirstOrderGravityScope.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` record the same no-promotion boundary. No W4
  calibration authority, finite-r Bianchi theorem, sourced Einstein equation,
  GR/G4/G6 closure, or GR/QFT promotion was constructed.

- assign conditional post-W2/W3/W9 next-lane tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record six downstream
  lanes under the explicit hypothetical that a future commit closes W2, W3, and
  W9. The current repo state is preserved as blocked; the new assignments cover
  W4/W5 shared PDF intake, W4 calibration authority, W3 non-collapse
  hardening, G2 Maxwell, G3 Schrodinger, and GR matter coupling. These are
  conditional staging lanes and do not promote W4, W5, G2, G3, GR, G6, W7, or
  the non-limited paper.

- sharpen the G3 Schrodinger theorem surface:
  `SchrodingerEvolutionScope.agda`, `Docs/SchrodingerEvolutionScope.md`, and
  `TODO.md` now record the inspected finite Hamiltonian/unitary-like support
  and the offline-L2 obstruction certificate while adding explicit
  Poincare-to-Galilei, Galilei/Hamiltonian, CCR compatibility, and MDL-to-L2
  seam obligations. The exact missing fields include
  `poincareToGalileiContractionDerived`,
  `galileiHamiltonianCompatibilityDerived`, `ccrCompatibilityDerived`, and
  `mdlToL2SeamDerived`; the scope now also records their exact upstream theorem
  types as `PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType`,
  `GalileiHamiltonianCompatibilityDerivedType`, `CCRCompatibilityDerivedType`,
  and `MDLToL2SeamDerivedType`. No `SchrodingerEvolutionTheorem` or G3 closure
  is constructed.

- sharpen the G3 Poincare-to-Galilei carrier-level obstruction:
  `SchrodingerEvolutionScope.agda` now records
  `G3PoincareToGalileiCarrierLevelObstruction`, naming the exact missing
  carrier/type chain from `PoincareSectorCarrier` through
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` plus the upstream theorem type
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType
  obligationSchrodingerHamiltonianEvolutionFields`. This is an obstruction
  packet only; no contraction theorem inhabitant or new postulate was added.

- add the G3 Poincare-Galilei carrier-chain surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` and
  `Docs/G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.md` now record the reusable
  `PoincareSectorCarrier -> NonRelativisticLimitCarrier ->
  GalileiSectorCarrier -> PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` chain with a
  non-promoting `DASHIState` marker. The exact downstream Schrodinger
  obligation remains `PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType
  obligationSchrodingerHamiltonianEvolutionFields`; no
  `poincareToGalileiContractionDerived` inhabitant is constructed.

- continue the G3 Poincare-sector carrier layer:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now defines an
  independent `PoincareSectorCarrier` record with state/operator/action,
  CCR-shaped `Op` and commutator surfaces, metric, translation-generator,
  Lorentz-generator, and Poincare bracket-relation fields. The canonical chain
  now carries a non-promoting obligation packet naming the missing concrete
  `CarrierOperator`, commutator closure, metric/signature witness, and
  translation/translation, Lorentz/translation, and Lorentz/Lorentz relation
  proofs. No Poincare algebra witness or contraction theorem is constructed.

- add non-promoting G3 IW and MDL-density surfaces:
  `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now records
  `G3IWAssociatedGradedObligationSurface` for the missing contraction
  filtration, associated graded, carrier algebra, filtered bracket law,
  contraction parameter, Poincare-at-`p2` carrier/isomorphism, and Galilei
  associated-graded identification. It also records
  `G3MDLDensityToL2ObligationSurface`, which reuses the inhabited finite
  `shiftPhaseWaveDensityMonotone` and `shiftPointDensityMonotone` laws while
  keeping the positive L2 density/seam theorem as the exact
  `MDLToL2SeamDerivedType obligationSchrodingerHamiltonianEvolutionFields`
  obligation. No unguarded postulate, IW contraction theorem, or MDL-to-L2
  theorem inhabitant was added.

- record W2 governance-token constructor obstruction:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/W2GovernanceTokenConstructorObstruction.agda`,
  `Docs/W2GovernanceTokenConstructorObstruction.md`, and `TODO.md` now record
  that the landed self-issuance policy is permissive only at the evidence-class
  layer. It constructs no W2 token, and the current Agda type still lacks a
  real `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken` constructor or typed
  policy-hook inhabitant. This keeps W2 non-promoted and names the first
  missing constructor before the separate natural/p2 and carrier-general
  convergence payloads.

- assign guarded W2/W3/W9 follow-up tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record three narrow
  workers for the latest immediate-token/proof proposal. The tranche explicitly
  allows W2/W3 token or W9 theorem construction only if the existing Agda
  interfaces provide a real constructor path; otherwise workers must return a
  typed obstruction or request surface. This assignment does not itself promote
  W2, W3, W9, G5, or the non-limited paper.

- integrate W9 follow-up obstruction sharpening:
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now names
  `Canonical15PressureWitnessType` as the missing theorem needed to identify
  cancellation pressure with transported contraction energy. The inspected
  case-split, contraction-forces, signature-31, and B4 weighted-Qcore routes
  remain non-promoting because none supplies the required pressure witness or
  W9 kill constructor.

- assign non-limited paper closure bundle lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record the six parallel
  assignments needed to turn current obligation surfaces into one
  theorem-facing non-limited-paper dependency object: W3/W2 authority
  governance, W9 pressure equality/obstruction, W4 Z-peak data anchor,
  CT18/DY convention binding, G2/G3/G4 theorem kernels, and paper-level claim
  governance. This is coordination only; no authority token, theorem closure,
  W9 closure, G6 closure, or paper admissibility claim is constructed.
  The worker board now also records the refined phase sequence: immediate
  no-dependency lanes, short-term CT18/W4 intake, medium G2/G3/GR/G6 theorem
  lanes, and final G4/W7 packaging, with the critical path kept as routing
  metadata rather than a promotion claim.

- integrate first non-limited paper closure worker returns:
  the G2, G3, and GR scope modules now contain theorem-kernel obligation
  records for Maxwell sector restriction, Schrodinger evolution/contraction,
  and finite-r GR/Bianchi/matter-coupling work. A new
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` module represents the 12-step
  non-limited paper roadmap as typed status fields with computed
  admissibility; the canonical state remains blocked at
  `missingRoadmapGovernance`. These additions are non-promoting and do not
  close G2, G3, GR/G4, G6, W7, W9, the non-limited paper, or full unification.

- integrate remaining non-limited paper closure worker returns:
  governance docs now define a bounded self-issuance policy fork for W2/W3
  evidence classes without populating tokens; the W9 canonical-15 `refl` route
  is refuted by a typed normal-form mismatch (`2` versus `10`); the W4 Z-peak
  anchor run is checksum-bound and records `chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`
  while keeping accepted DY authority absent; and CT18NLO is recorded as local
  candidate provenance with an expanded LHAPDF/PDF intake contract. These are
  routing and obstruction/authority surfaces only, not W2/W3/W4/W5/W9 or paper
  promotions.

- record W4/W5 LHAPDF intake preflight obstruction:
  `scripts/w4w5_pdf_lhapdf_intake_preflight.py` now emits a fail-closed
  W4/W5 PDF intake artifact. The 2026-05-13 rerun records system LHAPDF
  tooling present (`/usr/bin/lhapdf`, `/usr/bin/lhapdf-config`, and system
  Python `lhapdf` at `6.5.5`) and repo-local CT18NLO resolvable with
  `LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=/usr/share/lhapdf/LHAPDF:$PWD/scripts/data/pdf`. The repo
  `.venv` still lacks the Python `lhapdf` module, no local MSHT20 grid was
  found, and a fresh CT18 equivalent-table candidate packet remains at
  `logs/research/w4w5_pdf_ct18_candidate_run_20260513.json` SHA-256
  `7b4e5e815c3e65619cd9591734eb00e7c80be0402c6d06c3c8d33d1c8da6609f`. The
  provider-authority obstruction artifact is
  `logs/research/w4w5_pdf_lhapdf_intake_obstruction_20260513.json` SHA-256
  `082448674db69767aff1897f7fb66054a6dbc3a70b86f31813185a6a2c10fd41`.
  W4/W5 receipt surfaces and blocker docs cite the obstruction while keeping
  the CT18 numerics candidate-only and non-promoting.

- add corrected CT18 DY luminosity convention diagnostic:
  `scripts/run_w4w5_ct18_corrected_dy_luminosity.py` computes the full-`x`
  charge-weighted `dL/dtau` convention with system LHAPDF and records the
  non-promoting artifact
  `logs/research/w4w5_ct18_corrected_dy_luminosity_20260513.json` SHA-256
  `34d4a317d29b23a39e6d0b865028ba8640059123371dddfdf443e4b0e8ec43a8`.
  The `dtau` mass-window `L(106-170)/L(76-106)` correction is
  `0.9931829614316737`, not target `0.8804486068`; W4/W5 remain blocked on
  `missingAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`. A focused pytest regression
  covers the `dx/x` convention.

- sharpen W4 provider calibration-authority surfaces:
  `W4PhysicalUnitAuthorityRequestSurface.agda` now exposes a provider
  response/receipt surface for physical-unit authority and a parameterized
  quotient-sensitive cross-band witness surface over an existing
  `QuotientLawAtWitness canonicalCandidate256QuotientLaw`. The witness surface
  packages the internal TSFV `T` involution, compatibility, positive
  non-collapse, and `T`-flipped non-collapse while preserving the external
  chemistry-law receipt and physical-unit authority blockers. The docs and
  TODO entry mirror the same non-promoting boundary: no
  `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationAuthorityToken`, external calibration
  receipt, or W4 promotion is constructed.

- add DASHI-Markov compatibility surface:
  `Docs/DASHIMarkovCompatibility.md`, `DASHI/Core/DashiMarkov.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Process/DASHIMarkovCompatibility.agda` define Markov structure as a
  downstream projection of a DASHI lane. The native state is the typed joined
  slice of carrier, residual/pressure state, open obligations, accepted
  authorities, admissibility boundary, and promotion status. The Agda surfaces
  record structural transition, history sufficiency, multiscale joined state,
  and optional relation-valued kernel compatibility without adding stochastic
  assumptions, stationarity, HMM/MDP machinery, promotion receipts, or a global
  latent oracle.

- stage canonical HEPData JSON payloads for W3 authority review:
  browser-downloaded HEPData table JSON exports for `t19`, `t20`, `t43`, and
  `t44` are staged under
  `logs/research/provider_inputs/hepdata_ins2079374/` with checksums recorded
  in `checksums.txt`. The active W3 ratio payloads are now hash-bound and
  semantically checked against the local CSV cache: `t43` has `18/18` matching
  ratio rows and `t44` has `324/324` matching total-covariance entries. The W3
  docs and receipt/intake surfaces now record this as canonical-payload
  discovery completed while preserving the no-self-issuance boundary: no
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, accepted external receipt, G5 closure, or
  unification promotion is constructed locally. The W4 physical-unit request
  docs also note that the proton-mass candidate route should use CODATA 2022
  `938.27208943(29) MeV`, not the stale CODATA 2018 value.

- add W3 authority-token governance obstruction audit:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenGovernanceObstruction.agda` records that the
  landed governance policy permits bounded public-DOI/frozen-commit
  self-issuance only at policy level; the Agda token remains constructorless.
  The exact missing items are the `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`
  constructor/governance hook, `Pack.missingAcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, and
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenReceipt.authorityToken`. The audit also
  records that the non-collapse witness is already represented runner-side by
  `canonicalHEPDataW3T43RunnerPerBinNonCollapseReceipt`, while provider-grade
  external receipt and the authority token remain absent. No W3 promotion or
  accepted external receipt is constructed.

- harden W3 non-collapse runner receipt validation:
  `Docs/W3NonCollapseRunnerReceiptHardening.md`,
  `scripts/check_w3_noncollapse_receipt.py`, and
  `tests/test_w3_noncollapse_receipt.py` now verify that the frozen t43
  comparison JSON checksum, selected bin-12 witness, canonical t43/t44 JSON
  checksums, and Agda runner receipt literals agree. The checker fails closed if
  the local artifact claims provider-grade non-collapse or W3 authority-token /
  external-receipt construction. This confirms runner-side non-collapse is
  complete at the local receipt level, while provider-grade external
  non-collapse and `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` remain absent.

- refresh complete physics-unification roadmap:
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md` now records the active
  strict dependency path to a publishable physics-unification claim: internal
  construction, empirical contact, and cross-lane closure/publication audit.
  The roadmap names the current state as one closed gate (`G1`), partial or
  blocked bridge surfaces for `G2`-`G5`, and absent `G6`/`G7` packages. The
  older HEP-R54 fastest-path section is retained only as historical traceability
  and marked superseded. This is documentation/governance only; it adds no
  theorem closure, external authority, promotion receipt, or unification claim.

- add G6 cross-lane commuting theorem skeleton:
  `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton.agda` records the typed diagram
  obligation for the common-spine commuting theorem: lane embeddings,
  recovery morphisms, section proofs, and the derived equality chain once
  those sections are supplied. The surface is a record obligation rather than
  top-level postulates and has status `skeletonOnlyNoPromotion`. It does not
  close G6, replace G2/G3/G4/G5, or construct a complete-unification claim.

- wire G6 cross-lane commuting skeleton into roadmap diagrams:
  `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml` and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now include
  explicit `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton` nodes labelled SKELETON /
  no-promotion / postulate-obligation only. The wiring routes G1-G5 inputs
  through the skeleton before the G6/cross-lane consistency target, without
  implying G6 theorem closure or complete unification.

- sharpen accepted DY luminosity convention authority surface:
  `AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthorityReceipt.agda` and the W4/W5 DY
  diagnostic now require luminosity values, efficiency/acceptance model,
  systematic budget, CMS-SMP publication pointer, normalization-preservation
  law, and conversion law in addition to the existing PDF/provenance fields.
  Provider docs and the example JSON mirror the same fail-closed packet shape;
  no W4/W5 promotion or synthetic external authority was added.

- add GRQFT partial consumer receipt:
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligationV2.agda` now inhabits a partial consumer receipt
  for internally adaptable carriers: spacetime from the known-limits GR bridge
  carrier, wave state from the known-limits QFT bridge, a spinor adapter over
  that wave-state carrier, and the internal gauge-representation carrier. The
  request pack records this V2 partial receipt as reusable input while keeping
  stress-energy, curvature/Einstein laws, interaction closure, PDF authority,
  empirical validation, promotion authority, and full `GRQFTClosurePromotionReceipt`
  external-gated.

## 2026-05-12

- add W2 canonical pressure / realization-metric P2 obstruction:
  `W2CanonicalPressureMetricP2BridgeOrObstruction.agda` defines the explicit
  offline-L2 admissible `Nat -> Nat` candidate family from the canonical
  pressure scalar to the inhabited realization-indexed metric scalar and
  returns `W2KillEvidence` as an obstruction. The obstruction consumes
  `CanonicalP2OfflineL2ObstructionCertificate`; every admissible candidate
  would need the below-delta p2-key forcing bridge that certificate rejects.
  This does not construct `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken` or a
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionReceipt`.

- add LILA-R4 Theta/J bridge citation boundary:
  `LilaE8ThetaJBridgeSurface.agda` records a cross-language
  `LeanSiblingCitationReceipt` for `../dashi_lean4/MoonshineEarn.lean`
  after the exact requested `../dashilean4/MoonshineEarn.lean` path was not
  present. The receipt binds SHA-256
  `62343c34a138a66e5374c17ee92b07104023b1c13d651f56ea17ab2e271d268a` and
  names discovered Moonshine/Ramanujan Lean theorems, but asserts no Lean proof
  in Agda and gives no LILA-R5, W3, G5, physics, or unification promotion.

- add Drosophila Release 6 genome W4 candidate packet:
  downloaded the NCBI `GCF_000001215.4` genomic FASTA and CDS FASTA, added a
  reproducible extractor, and emitted a checksum-bound authority/codon packet.
  `DrosophilaGenomeW4CandidateAuthorityReceipt.agda` records the corrected
  Release 6 reference DOI `10.1101/gr.185579.114`, rejects the previously
  suggested `10.1126/science.1237175` for this route, binds the genomic FASTA
  SHA-256
  `e69e907b5e87ce756236dcef93e82001cfd08f1a0ed5f22e36cbbd3a87ebc57d`, binds
  the CDS FASTA SHA-256
  `3f379cec1d952f9a1c22e2b6dd9ff8eefce6da97ffb198cde93dc0a17c40da01`, and
  records a CDS-based non-uniform codon witness. This remains candidate-only:
  no TSFV calibration law, Candidate256 authority token, Candidate256 physical
  calibration receipt, W4 promotion, Brain promotion, or unification claim was
  constructed.

- add Brain proviso and physics-boundary audit tranche:
  the Brain lane is now explicitly conditional rather than permanently
  ontologically excluded. `BrainGovernanceProviso.agda` keeps Brain/physics
  promotion flags false and allows lateral support review only after typed
  exhaustion of a direct W1-W6 lane with no retarget availability.
  New docs record W1-W6 assignability, Brain-to-physics boundary handles,
  W4/W5's accepted-DY convention blocker, and W2/W9 promotion-boundary blockers.
  The result is non-promoting: Brain evidence does not replace W1-W6 kill
  conditions, does not construct W2/W9/W4/W5 authority, and does not support a
  physics-promotion or unification claim.

- orchestrate W3/W4/W7/W8/W2/W9 plus dashiBRAIN integration lanes:
  W7 bounded claim-governance and W8 first empirical gate were audited and
  already typecheck without edits. W4 Z-peak data and runner wiring were
  verified, producing the existing negative adequacy artifact
  `chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`; W4 remains blocked on dirty Z-peak shape
  adequacy / accepted DY convention, not missing t21/t22 files. W2 targeted
  surfaces now typecheck under 30s; the active blocker is the constructorless
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`, with the p2 bridge still named
  as a downstream technical ingredient. W9 now records that the canonical pair
  route is typed-obstructed and the weighted-support route is accepted-only
  until a W9 kill-route constructor consumes it. The Drosophila hemibrain lane
  now has non-promoting external numeric receipts, a checksum manifest,
  single-scale closure/gauge robustness receipts, and a typed coarse-grain
  persistence obstruction. No W3 authority token, W4 calibration, W8 external
  origin authority, W2 promotion, W9 kill receipt, Brain promotion, physics
  promotion, or unification claim was constructed.

## 2026-05-06

- add evidence-decision forcing artifacts:
  DY authority intake now has a provider response checklist and a syntactically
  valid example authority packet that intentionally fails closed as
  `insufficient`. The DY luminosity adapter smoke artifact records absent
  packet exit `50`, insufficient authority exit `51`, and accepted-shaped
  temporary fixture exit `0` while preserving `computed-not-promoted` status.
  W3 now has a provider response checklist; Candidate256 minimal missing
  fields are reduced to W4-derived values plus one external calibration
  authority payload; the Einstein candidate interface has a guarded patch plan;
  and the limited SM+GR paper readiness matrix maps receipts to paper sections,
  allowed claims, forbidden claims, blockers, and next actions. No authority
  token, W4/W5 promotion, Candidate256 calibration, stress-energy receipt,
  Einstein law, GRQFT validation, or limited-unification claim was constructed.

## 2026-05-05

- add submission and compatibility readiness artifacts:
  final provider-facing submission bundles now exist for the W4/W5 accepted DY
  luminosity convention and the W3 accepted evidence authority token. A shared
  DY luminosity adapter consumes accepted/replacement authority-shaped JSON and
  emits W4/W5 luminosity artifacts while failing closed without provider
  authority and luminosities. New claim-boundary and compatibility audit docs
  keep Level 1/2/3 publication language, Candidate256 calibration, and W4
  matter/stress-energy downstream of inhabited receipts. No authority token,
  W4/W5 promotion, calibration receipt, stress-energy receipt, Einstein law, or
  GRQFT promotion was constructed.

- assign receipt-ingestion and downstream-readiness lanes:
  six non-promoting lanes now prepare the next handoff layer after the DY
  provider packet. New response-ingestion surfaces exist for accepted DY
  luminosity authority and W3 accepted evidence authority; W4 and W5 now have
  fail-closed runner/receipt templates gated on accepted provider packets;
  Candidate256 physical calibration and W4 matter/stress-energy now have
  explicit preflight contracts. No W4 adequacy, W5 pass, W3 token,
  Candidate256 calibration, stress-energy receipt, GR law, or GRQFT promotion
  was constructed.

- add DY convention authority provider packet:
  `Docs/AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthorityProviderPacket.md` now
  externalizes the W4/W5 accepted Drell-Yan luminosity convention request in a
  sendable form. It names the required PDF, LHAPDF, checksum, scale, rapidity,
  mass-bin, flavour, integration, source, and provenance fields, preserves the
  failed fixed-`x`, `t45/z_peak`, and `t45/t43` probes as negative diagnostics,
  and keeps W4/W5 non-promoting until an accepted authority receipt exists.

- run six-lane limited SM+GR authority/gate follow-up:
  W4/W5 accepted DY convention surfaces now canonicalize
  `missingAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority` and the shared
  `missingSharedAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority` without promoting
  W4/W5. `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` now exposes the
  provider-facing token field and preserves the constructorless
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` boundary. W4 physical calibration,
  matter/stress-energy, discrete Einstein-law, and GRQFT/QFT consumer lanes now
  preserve their downstream order: accepted DY convention authority, W4
  adequacy, `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt`, W4 matter/stress
  energy, discrete Einstein law, and GRQFT validation. No authority token,
  calibration receipt, stress-energy receipt, Einstein-law receipt, or GRQFT
  closure promotion was constructed.

- assign limited SM+GR unification paper tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records orchestrator id
  `limited-sm-gr-unification-2026-05-05` with six highest-gain lanes toward a
  limited known-limit SM+GR paper claim: W3 accepted authority, W4/W5 accepted
  Drell-Yan luminosity convention, W4 physical calibration, W4-derived
  matter/stress-energy, discrete Einstein law, and QFT/GRQFT consumer
  validation. `TODO.md` mirrors the same promotion guards: no synthetic
  authority tokens, no W4/W5 close without accepted convention/provenance, no
  GR promotion before W4 matter/stress-energy, and no limited SM+GR claim
  without GR equation law plus QFT/GRQFT consumer validation.

- integrate limited SM+GR unification worker lanes:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` now contains a final
  request-only provider-facing handoff packet. W4/W5 convention and PDF intake
  surfaces now make accepted DY luminosity/bin-integration authority the exact
  shared first missing item. W4 physical calibration surfaces now keep
  `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt` downstream of accepted
  PDF-backed W4 adequacy. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` now exposes
  `missingW4AnchorArtifactReceiptForMatterStress` and packages the future
  discrete Einstein-law consumer payload. GRQFT request/diagnostic surfaces now
  include the empirical validation receipt payload tied to `grEquationLaw` and
  `qftInteractionLaw`. No authority token, W4/W5 promotion, GR promotion, or
  GRQFT closure promotion was constructed.

- clarify Wikidata global-latent formalism:
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`,
  `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` now distinguish the formal endstate
  from current repo/runtime state. The formalism is recorded as monotone
  structural coherence over a snapshot-derived global ontology index; bounded
  QID diagnostics and review packets are local projections. The remaining gaps
  are still explicit: QID/PID/statement carriers, live/global ontology index,
  mutation/filter carriers, QID-only repair projection, global severity theorem,
  and governance-token surfaces. No edit authority, runtime receipt, or P0
  promotion was constructed.

- assign Wikidata monotone structural coherence worker lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records orchestrator id
  `wikidata-monotone-coherence-2026-05-05` with four read-only docs/governance
  sidecar lanes for the pasted formalism: residual-core Agda gap analysis,
  ontology-index and bounded-slice surface scan, docs/governance placement,
  and validation policy. `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` now reflect the same non-promoting boundary: no
  Wikidata edit authority without external promotion receipt, no fabricated
  runtime `PNFEmissionReceipt`, no assumed live dump/index, and no monotonicity
  theorem without the filter-respecting edit-stream precondition.

- attempt CT18NLO PDF intake:
  direct `lhapdf` installation was unavailable (`pip` has no wheel in the
  repo-local virtualenv), so the public CT18NLO LHAPDF grid was downloaded to
  `scripts/data/pdf/`. Added `scripts/extract_ct18_pdf_packet.py` to parse the
  `lhagrid1` central member without LHAPDF runtime bindings and emit
  `scripts/data/pdf/ct18_dashi_pdf_packet.json`. The archive digest is
  `c9127231e77e97cbec79cb5839203ab00f8db77237a061b61f9420f2b7b9c213`; the
  central grid digest is
  `375db856d2f8c7087a626c92ebf228d3f080e5de83175519778ffaf6e72e5410`. The
  local fixed-`x = 0.01` extraction gives W5 correction
  `1.0506681065158017`, not `0.8804486068`, so W4/W5 remain blocked on an
  accepted parton-luminosity/bin-integration convention and authority route,
  not on missing CT18 grid data. Updated the W4/W5 and W5 intake Agda surfaces
  accordingly; no W4/W5 promotion or PDF carrier was constructed.

- assign next-six blocker parallel tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records orchestrator id
  `next-six-blockers-2026-05-05` with six disjoint lanes: W4/W5 shared PDF
  intake, W9 theorem-interface bridge, W3 authority-token audit, W2
  promotion-token audit, W4 calibration/matter-source queue, and GR
  Einstein-law queue. `W4W5PDFSharedDependencyDiagnostic.agda` and
  `W5PDFCarrierExternalIntakeRequest.agda` now include exact PDF packet
  precision fields, local no-LHAPDF audit facts, and W4/W5 extraction
  contracts. `W4PhysicalCalibrationObligationSurface.agda` now records the
  post-PDF chain from shared PDF-backed Z-peak adequacy to external physical
  calibration, `matterFieldFromW4`, and `stressEnergyTensorFromW4`. W9, W3,
  W2, and GR returned no-change audits that preserve the current blockers and
  construct no promotions or authority tokens.

- record merged W4/W5 PDF dependency:
  `W4W5PDFSharedDependencyDiagnostic.agda` now records that W4 dirty Z-peak
  shape adequacy and W5 t45 correction share the same upstream
  CT18/MSHT/LHAPDF-compatible parton-luminosity intake. The diagnostic binds
  the current W4 failed shape fit (`chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`, digest
  `36191efc92cb3c9b1641c9206171a307c4796369a4acd1485bf87d1051662b8b`) and
  the W5 required correction `0.8804486068`, while explicitly constructing no
  W4 anchor closure, W4 promotion, W5 t45 promotion, or external PDF carrier.
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` imports the new diagnostic for
  discoverability.
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` additionally records
  that the proposed `pressure <= wQcoreBound^2` theorem is not accepted by the
  current W9 kill constructors without a typed bridge into the theorem-facing
  pair transport. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` now places the merged W4/W5
  PDF intake before future W4 matter-field/stress-energy receipts. W4 Z-peak
  diagnostics also record that no local CSS momentum-space/qT artifact with
  chi2/dof approximately `65` is present.

- integrate Z-peak/W9 theorem next-six assignment:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` now supports a governed dirty Z-peak
  shape-fit path: a declared uncalibrated t21 shape callable is fitted with
  one covariance-weighted scalar and the scalar is emitted as calibration
  metadata. `DASHI.Physics.Prediction.sigma_dashi:predict_dirty_z_peak_shape`
  wires the existing finite `sigma_DASHI` construction into that path without
  claiming upstream `pb` units. The current fit is inadequate
  (`chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`, scale `230534508.31238452`), so
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` and
  `W4ZPeakCalibrationAnchorReceipt.agda` move the W4 first missing item to
  shape adequacy rather than calibration-anchor closure.
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now records
  that the weighted-Qcore route still depends on the obstructed
  cancellation-pressure to weighted-quadratic identification at `(one , one)`,
  so W9 remains blocked. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` adds the future
  `W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt` shape and records W4 calibration
  authority as the post-anchor GR gate. W2, W3, and W5 were audited as
  no-change external/governance blockers.

- integrate W9/W4/governance/PDF tranche:
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now records the
  concrete canonical-15 counterexample and rejects the proposed canonical-state
  `refl` close. W4 public t21/t22 artifacts are now local with SHA-256 digests
  and parser-visible schema; the dirty Z-peak path parses the 18-bin
  measurement and 18 x 18 covariance matrix, then fails closed at the missing
  `compute_dashi_ratio` prediction API. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` now
  orders the W4-gated GR queue as anchor, calibration authority, matter field,
  stress-energy tensor, then discrete Einstein-equation law.
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` is packet-complete for
  external authority review but constructs no token.
  `W2GovernanceSelfIssuanceIntakeRequest.agda` records the W2 governance
  closing packet while keeping self-issuance unavailable.
  `W5CT18ExternalIntakeReceipt.agda` records the CT18/MSHT/LHAPDF packet fields
  required before W5 can consume the external PDF carrier.

- integrate W9/Qcore + W4/GR governance assignment round:
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` rejects the proposed
  W9 close in the actual repo types: the available weighted-support theorem is
  a `Nat` inequality, while the current W9 kill route still needs the
  canonical-15 `ℤ` pressure-to-contraction-energy equality, which remains
  obstructed. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` records GR as a W4-gated
  `G_mu_nu = 8pi T_mu_nu` obligation surface with matter coupling first
  missing, not as a curved-GR promotion. `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda`
  and `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` add a fail-closed dirty Z-peak CLI path
  for future t21/t22 runs, while preserving the missing-artifact and schema
  boundary. `W2W3SelfIssuanceGovernanceRulingDiagnostic.agda` records that W2
  and W3 remain blocked by constructorless authority tokens unless governance
  policy is explicitly amended.

- integrate Lyapunov-adapter / external-gap audit round:
  `W9LyapunovAdapterReceipt.agda` constructs a narrow
  `CancellationPressureLyapunovBridge` for `NormalizeAddState` using
  `carryDepth + carryBudget`, while
  `W9LyapunovIncompatibilityDiagnostic.agda` preserves the remaining dim-15
  pressure/Qcore blocker as
  `ExistingCancellationPressureCompatibilityObligation canonical15Theorem
  canonical15Dimension`. `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda`
  now records the no-network local audit of missing t21/t22 artifacts and the
  t43/t44-only runner interface. `W5PDFCarrierExternalConfirmedGap.agda`
  records that the local DGLAP/LO plus carrier-correction route is still
  insufficient and that CT18/MSHT/LHAPDF intake remains required.
  `DiscreteConnectionCandidateFromCRT.agda` records a diagnostic-only
  CRT-to-connection first-missing surface, with no asymptotic, Bianchi, or
  curved-GR promotion claim.

- integrate constructorless-token / retarget audit round:
  `W2PromotionAuthorityReceipt.agda` now consumes local uniform-rate support
  while preserving the constructorless W2 promotion authority boundary.
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` records the HEP-R55
  token-only external intake request and explicitly rejects local
  self-issuance. `W5PDFCarrierExternalIntakeRequest.agda` records absent local
  LHAPDF tooling and tightens the external provider payload. W9 now has
  `W9WeightedSupportRetargetConsumerReceipt.agda`, a non-promoting weighted
  support retarget-consumer acceptance receipt, while
  `W9LyapunovIncompatibilityDiagnostic.agda` keeps W9 blocked on the missing
  Lyapunov bridge. `DiscreteEinsteinTensorCandidate.agda` records that CRT/J
  p47/p59/p71 surfaces do not yet supply a carrier-internal non-flat
  connection.

- integrate W2/W3/GR fanout round:
  `UniformConvergenceRateSurface.agda` records the fixed local
  `NormalizeAddState` / `normalizeAdd` rate surface; `W2PromotionAuthorityReceipt.agda`
  records that W2 remains blocked on constructorless authority and
  carrier-general convergence packaging. `W4ZPeakCalibrationAnchorReceipt.agda`
  records missing t21/t22 artifacts and the t43/t44 runner boundary.
  `W9LyapunovIncompatibilityDiagnostic.agda` records that the weighted support
  bound is not a current Lyapunov/retarget consumer.
  `DiscreteEinsteinTensorCandidate.agda` records a flat-only GR candidate with
  first missing `missingNonFlatConnectionOrShift`. W7 bounded scope now includes
  W2 sum-invariance and Minkowski flat-space while excluding unification.
  `W5PDFCarrierExternalIntakeRequest.agda` records the missing external PDF
  carrier for required t45 correction `0.8804486068`.

- land W2 sum-invariance and GR flat-space receipts:
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/NormalizeAddSumPreservation.agda` proves by `refl` that
  `normalizeAdd` preserves `lhs + rhs` and the p-adic valuation of that sum for
  every tracked prime. `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda` now
  carries that positive invariant instead of the timeout-prone candidate-family
  imports. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MinkowskiLimitReceipt.agda` records the
  exact hyperbolic/Minkowski quadratic and the B4 intrinsic `sig31` match.
  These are theorem receipts, but W2 kill promotion still awaits the existing
  constructorless authority token and carrier-general convergence-rate
  packaging; curved GR recovery remains open.

- integrate fastest-path sidecar results:
  W5 now has `PDFCarrierLogRatioDiagnostic.agda`, threaded into
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligation.agda`, recording required t45 correction
  `0.8804486068` versus proxy `0.8751733190` while preserving
  `externallyPDFGated` status. W6 returned provider-ready with no edit because
  the existing runtime request pack already names the five payload fields. GR
  remains a diagnostic discrete metric/curvature target, not a recovery
  theorem. W2 returned a positive candidate-family first step, but W0 held it
  out of integration because the targeted `30s` Agda check exits `124`.

- launch the fastest-path-to-completion round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`,
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md`, and `TODO.md` now
  record that W2 is the critical-path fork for complete unification. `Turing` /
  `Cicero` (`019df414-e48e-7392-8e3d-30ca8e51b017`) owns the W2 positive
  natural `p2` candidate-family / bridge attempt. `Maxwell` / `Goodall`
  (`019df414-e56e-71a0-83ca-aa345005bdeb`) owns the W5 PDF-carrier correction
  diagnostic, `Liskov` / `Pauli`
  (`019df414-e65a-7542-a678-129149edb11c`) owns W6 runtime PNF readiness, and
  `Gauss` / `Darwin` (`019df414-e7c8-7d73-b059-d06de4839363`) owns the GR
  metric-recovery weakest-sufficient-target sidecar. HEP-R55/W3 is left as
  external provider engagement for `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`.

- launch the first-missing formalism alignment round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now assign W2 to `Turing` /
  `Hubble` (`019df410-7c68-7a80-a5be-466f6c3294ac`), W3 authority-token
  readiness to `Curie-Authority` / `Harvey`
  (`019df410-b29b-72b2-89da-45f70210360a`), W4 calibration alignment to
  `Faraday` / `Lovelace` (`019df410-80d5-7350-9981-eec179ea3c9b`), W5
  GRQFT/PDF closure alignment to `Maxwell` / `Newton`
  (`019df410-9402-73d2-acbb-f1caf7984ee5`), and W9 dim-15/retarget alignment
  to `Planck` / `Archimedes`
  (`019df410-9dff-79e3-bfda-42a67a86d250`). This round aligns proposed
  standalone formalisms with existing typed surfaces; it does not reopen
  HEP-R53 W3 non-collapse, fabricate authority/calibration/PDF receipts, or
  construct W2/W9 theorems.

- integrate first-missing formalism alignment results:
  W2 required no duplicate module because `NaturalP2BridgeOrObstructionReceipt`
  and the W2 kill condition already cover the requested bridge/obstruction
  formalism. W3 accepted-authority provider wording now records HEP-R55 as
  external-only for `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`. W4 adds
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationObligationSurface.agda`, a non-promoting aggregation
  naming `missingSameRecordT21T22ArtifactReceipt` as first missing while
  preserving the calibration authority boundary. W5 required no duplicate
  module because existing GRQFT/PDF request and diagnostic surfaces already
  cover the proposed formalism. W9 adds `Dim15DeltaToQuadraticObligation` in
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda`, naming the two
  surviving routes: dim-15 pressure-witness theorem or downstream retarget
  consumer acceptance.

- update W7 post-HEP-R53 publishable-scope governance:
  `ClaimGovernancePromotionObligation.agda` now binds the bounded W3 t43
  comparison-law receipt to the HEP-R53 runner-side non-collapse receipt. The
  exact admissible claim is formal carrier plus no-free-parameter below-Z t43
  phistar ratio comparison, `50-76 / 76-106 GeV`, `chi2/dof =
  2.1565191176`, and runner-side non-collapse witness. This is not complete
  unification, not full W3 accepted authority before HEP-R54, and not closure
  of W2, W4, W5, W6, W8, or W9.

- launch the HEP-R54 / publishable-scope sidecar round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now assign `Curie-W3` /
  `Confucius` (`019df40b-48e3-7291-b872-edcd5744cb71`) to the W3 accepted
  authority assembly attempt, `Arendt` / `Kant`
  (`019df40b-4a39-74f0-93d3-36973dc08e56`) to W7 bounded publishable-scope
  governance, and `Faraday-Hypatia` / `Ampere`
  (`019df40b-4b45-7453-9db4-ecfcc11eaf3d`) to W4/W8 sidecar status after
  HEP-R53. This is a coordination update only; no accepted authority token,
  W4 calibration, W8 origin authority, W2 theorem, W9 kill receipt, or full
  unification claim is constructed.

- integrate HEP-R54 / publishable-scope sidecar results:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityProviderAttempt.agda` now consumes HEP-R51/R52/R53 and
  records `missingAcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` as the first missing
  authority provider field; no `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` or
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt` is constructed. W7 governance now
  records the honest bounded publishable claim after HEP-R53: below-Z Drell-Yan
  phistar t43, formal carrier plus no-free-parameter comparison, `chi2/dof =
  2.1565191176`, and runner-side non-collapse evidence, explicitly not full
  unification or full W3 accepted authority. W8 origin request surfaces now
  list HEP-R53 as support evidence only, not origin authority. W4 remains
  blocked on same-record t21/t22 artifacts and Z-peak runner support.

- land HEP-R53 per-bin output and W3 t43 non-collapse witness receipt:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` now emits a `per_bin` payload containing
  per-bin prediction, data, covariance-diagonal uncertainty, and pull.
  `HEPDataW3NonCollapseWitnessReceipt.agda` records the runner-side t43
  non-collapse witness: bin `12`, prediction `0.0486590199823977`, data
  `0.049758`, uncertainty `0.00048197510309143566`, pull
  `-2.280159308132989`. The new artifact
  `/tmp/t43_clean_freeze_v2.json` has SHA-256
  `3987f82678943bab7679a9948e865f74f2263cdbe38a0e997734dad38939fda0` and
  projection digest
  `cc6ea1a8ea57ef376ae275c1b49e32b27d6d204d7b70cad5c6308b3f8a897a79`.
  Prediction bins are stable against the prior checksum-bound artifact, and
  covariance recomputation gives `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176275613`. HEP-R54
  accepted-authority assembly is now the next W3 action; no constructorless
  authority token or `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt` is fabricated here.

- record the W3 and W9 next-priority diagnostics:
  `W3T43AuthorityPacketCandidateDiagnostic.agda` records the checksum-bound
  t43 authority-packet candidate and strongest fallback residual witness
  candidate from `/tmp/t43_clean_freeze.json`, while explicitly noting that the
  artifact lacks `per_bin` and therefore cannot construct
  `nonCollapseWitnessReceipt`, `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, or
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt`.
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` records
  `currentW9RetargetConsumerAbsenceDiagnostic`, showing no in-repo downstream
  retarget consumer or acceptance receipt exists. These are non-promoting
  diagnostics only.

- land the W2 Path B Offline L2 insufficiency diagnostic:
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda` now records
  `canonicalOfflineL2InsufficientForConvergenceRate`, tying the existing
  `CanonicalP2OfflineL2ObstructionCertificate` to the convergence-rate
  obligation. The result is explicitly non-promoting: Offline L2 proves that
  below-delta normalized-shadow candidates cannot force the canonical `p2` key,
  so it does not supply carrier transport, rate preservation, uniform
  realization evidence, or a positive p2-key schedule bridge. W2 remains
  blocked with a sharper first-missing lift diagnostic.

- record the W4 Z-peak dirty-boundary support diagnostic:
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` now records that the
  requested same-record t21/t22 dirty boundary check is blocked locally because
  `scripts/data/hepdata` lacks the t21 measurement and t22 covariance CSVs, and
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` is currently a t43/t44 runner rather than a
  generic `--mode` / `--data` / `--covariance` runner. No numeric Z-peak
  anchor, calibration authority, physical unit carrier, dimensional law, or W4
  promotion is constructed.

- launch the next-priority worker round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record the live
  assignments for W3 authority-packet preparation (`Curie-W3` / `Kuhn`,
  `019df3fb-f403-7301-a6b6-abd8ffae6a19`), W2 Offline L2 sufficiency
  (`Turing` / `Mendel`, `019df3fb-f520-78f0-9d47-5e718b1c59ac`), W4 Z-peak
  anchor preparation (`Faraday` / `Meitner`,
  `019df3fb-f611-7f82-9ab3-3596152f70f1`), and W9 retarget consumer scan
  (`Planck` / `Einstein`, `019df3fb-f7f7-7903-be2a-57d29bc2832f`). This is a
  coordination update only: no W3 accepted authority receipt, W2 theorem, W4
  calibration receipt, or W9 kill receipt is constructed.

- resolve the W2 Natural p2 convergence isolation timeout:
  `CanonicalScheduleIndependentNaturalChargeNextIngredientGap.agda` now keeps
  the p2 key, schedule admissibility, closure dynamics, and richer invariant
  unlock claims behind an abstract gap boundary. This preserves the landed base
  natural-charge law, widening obstruction, and p2 schedule-bridge obstruction
  fields while avoiding normalization of the concrete carrier/fibre proof spine
  during W2 governance checks. `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda`
  now exports the canonical
  `NaturalP2BridgeCarrierGeneralConvergenceObstruction` under `timeout 30s`
  validation. No natural p2 bridge, promotion authority, or carrier-general
  convergence receipt is constructed.

- sharpen the W4 same-record Z-peak calibration-anchor request:
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` now includes a typed
  `W4SameRecordZPeakT21T22ArtifactReceiptRequest` for the t21 measurement and
  t22 covariance anchors, with DOI equalities, requested checksum/header/bin
  fields, and a non-promotion request boundary.
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` adds the matching
  provider payload requirement. This is request/diagnostic progress only:
  no `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationAuthorityToken`, physical unit carrier,
  dimensional preservation proof, ratio-calibration law, or W4 promotion is
  constructed.

- sharpen W6 runtime PNF provider diagnostic:
  `PNFResidualConsumerNextObligation.agda` now names missing
  receipt-backed residual computation as an explicit missing runtime source,
  and `PNFResidualConsumerRuntimeProviderAttempt.agda` exports the canonical
  provider output as diagnostic-only. No concrete consumer profile, runtime
  receipt id, paired `PNFEmissionReceipt` values, residual computation, or
  Hecke candidate-pool receipt id is fabricated.

- add W3 residual observable-class receipt/proto alignment:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassReceiptProtoAlignment.agda` records the typed
  W3 residual-closure output for Curie-W3. The local `phistar_50_76` proto
  receipt is aligned to the provider-facing `residualObservableClassReceipt`
  slot and may be returned as the first-missing typed diagnostic, but it remains
  unaccepted: residual payload intake still rejects at
  `firstMissingResidualObservableClass`, the residual authority gate remains
  blocked, `nonCollapseWitnessReceipt` is still a later missing receipt, and no
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt` or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion is constructed.
- sharpen W5 GRQFT/PDF carrier diagnostics:
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligation.agda` now treats the external PDF
  carrier/mass-kernel route as a first-class missing upstream field and
  carries a non-promoting `GRQFTPDFCarrierPrerequisiteDiagnostic`.
  `GRQFTConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` marks that prerequisite source as
  missing, and `GRQFTClosurePromotionReceiptRequestPack.agda` adds it to the
  exact provider payload request. No PDF carrier, promotion authority, GR/QFT
  law, witness, empirical validation, or closure-promotion receipt is
  constructed.
- hold the W2 Natural p2 convergence output for isolation:
  the W2 worker output is not included in the safe-lane integration because
  `timeout 30s agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda`
  timed out while checking
  `CanonicalScheduleIndependentNaturalChargeNextIngredientGap.agda` through the
  import chain. W2 remains pending a bounded isolation round before its typed
  obstruction is committed.
- assign the W3-promoted residual closure lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records
  `w3-promoted-residual-closure-2026-05-05` as the active orchestrator handoff
  for the remaining gates. `Noether` audits W1's unblocked final seam,
  `Turing` owns W2 p2/rate, `Curie-W3` owns W3 authority plus residual
  observable class, `Faraday` owns W4 calibration/Z-peak/cross-band witness,
  `Maxwell` owns W5 GRQFT/PDF carrier, `Liskov` owns W6 runtime PNF intake,
  `Arendt` owns W7 claim governance, `Hypatia` owns W8 first-empirical-gate
  origin recording, and `Planck` owns W9 dim-15 pressure compatibility. This
  is a coordination update only and constructs no missing external receipt,
  authority token, calibration token, runtime payload, or W2/W9 theorem.
- record the first W3-promoted residual closure results:
  `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalObligation.agda` now contains
  `OriginReceiptPromotionFirstGateSatisfiedReceipt`, tying the bounded HEP-R52
  W3 t43 comparison-law receipt to W8's first empirical gate while preserving
  `empiricalBlocked` for the current origin receipt and leaving
  `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalReceipt` external. `ClaimGovernancePromotionObligation.agda`
  now contains `BoundedW3T43ClaimGovernancePromotionReceipt`, documenting the
  bounded publishable scope for below-Z Drell-Yan phistar ratio
  `50-76 / 76-106 GeV`, t43 lane, `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176`, clean
  deterministic carrier, no posterior tuning, and no external PDF.
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` indexes HEP-R51 and HEP-R52. The W1 audit
  confirmed the final seam is already landed and
  `w1KillCondition.currentState = unblocked`; W2, W3 residual authority, W4,
  W5, W6, and W9 remain open.
- add HEP-R45 observable-definition receipt:
  `HEPDataObservableDefinitionReceipt.agda` records the local t43/t44 and
  t45/t46 HEPData CSV header facts as a non-promoting receipt. Both ratio
  value tables use `DSIG/DPHISTAR / DSIG/DPHISTAR`: t43 is measured
  differential cross section in `50 <= Mll < 76` divided by `76 <= Mll < 106`,
  and t45 is `106 <= Mll < 170` divided by `76 <= Mll < 106`. The values are
  not normalized by bin width, and the normalized-by-total-cross-section
  hypothesis is blocked. Added `scripts/diagnose_hepdata_ratio_conventions.py`
  to print the table DOI/name/description/observable and ratio ranges; local
  output gives t43 min/max/mean `0.036572` / `0.078012` / `0.0469034` and t45
  min/max/mean `0.020919` / `0.030239` / `0.0262884`. This is diagnostic only:
  no accepted comparison law, empirical adequacy, or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R43/HEP-R44 mass-window-general prediction diagnostics:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi_mass_general.py` is a fresh
  non-promoting predictor that does not encode the HEP-R41 t43
  residual-shape response. `HEPDataMassWindowGeneralPredictionLawDiagnostic.agda`
  records the corrected obligation after the t45 holdout failure: t44 is
  covariance-only, and the next law must predict both `50-76 / 76-106` and
  `106-170 / 76-106` without observed-table tuning. Dirty runs of the fresh
  predictor failed both targets: t43 artifact
  `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r43_mass_general_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `235e289e79d9aca474fbb16ddf8dd11359ff4c9e807d07d032e4e9e15dedb359`,
  projection digest
  `ba9b9f821d1a17ab3c3d9f175081f260665efc5ebc795bedcb2a5479700c678d`,
  and chi2/dof `1770377.845008375`; t45 artifact
  `/tmp/t45_projection_hep_r43_mass_general_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `301c64668a47404b0bc8d75ce79542795f974633ce3fb02df4e851b8be503171`,
  projection digest
  `8adc2d9d5cc764123be371b3d428169356579802b77be46847ea5bfeb6bc5927`,
  and chi2/dof `122.01665676644487`. `HEPDataMassWindowGeneralPredictionRunDiagnostic.agda`
  records this as a model-gap diagnostic only: no accepted comparison law,
  empirical adequacy, or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R42 t45/t46 independent holdout diagnostic:
  checksum-bound holdout artifacts were added for HEPData t45
  (`bcc1450c5c7818e2792f06f1882c6facdea2e4079070b777f2c5ac3b87343433`)
  and t46
  (`e325d82ec3ba6962042c54f6b98a911d456f9bf00db22d2238b0cd76e71dcb3f`).
  `DASHI.Physics.Prediction.sigma_dashi` now exposes
  `predict_ratio_106_170_over_76_106` for the unchanged HEP-R41 model.
  The dirty holdout artifact `/tmp/t45_projection_hep_r42_holdout_dirty.json`
  has SHA-256
  `60242829cd37a9508c1b21da969c43383c1e00f6e4b6c77457ee5d1a67e2b4e3`,
  projection digest
  `2ac58b6d7c16384769dae42be2877c0025797acacc730f9d9443b00e538bda25`,
  and chi2/dof `222.54402462995546`. `HEPDataT45HoldoutValidationDiagnostic.agda`
  records this as an independent holdout failure, proving the HEP-R41 t43
  numeric pass is not a general empirical adequacy receipt.
- add HEP-R41 posterior shape-response diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now includes a posterior
  shoulder-dip / recovery-bump response after HEP-R40 residual inspection.
  The dirty artifact `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r41_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `61bdfa327ee79a8979fe28c932ddf3f39052adc23aa94ef9b070c9ccfcafc905`,
  projection digest
  `4f131476a22ea8b9315370378f106e19c044964335f0b4a1a7d6e846e90ee336`,
  and covariance-aware chi2/dof `1.7408778006026118`.
  `HEPDataT43PosteriorShapeResponseDiagnostic.agda` records this as
  numeric-pass / governance-fail only: posterior residual-shape tuning,
  synthetic dirty freeze, no accepted comparison law, no empirical adequacy,
  and no W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R40 neutral-current continuum refinement diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now includes a bounded diagnostic
  gamma/Z neutral-current continuum factor over the HEP-R39 v2 construction.
  The dirty artifact `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r40_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `7772bad5b8bdc7407b6432d8fe7585fb7ed357f6eed3db4e3d6883c9c1cffac6`,
  projection digest
  `96be51a8019b7fcd88e36def0d61fd483c9b3bfe4a1698c9cce6079188567ff9`,
  and covariance-aware chi2/dof `28.65761549390974`.
  `HEPDataT43NeutralCurrentContinuumRefinementDiagnostic.agda` records the
  result as another model-gap reduction only: synthetic dirty freeze, no
  accepted comparison law, no empirical adequacy, and no W3/W4/W5/W8
  promotion.
- add HEP-R39 sigma_DASHI v2 model-gap refinement diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now uses a phi-star-dependent
  carrier depth, Breit-Wigner mass-window normalization, and smooth
  finite-carrier phase measure while preserving no observed t43 ratio seeding,
  no covariance input, and no promotion claims.
  `HEPDataT43SigmaDASHIModelGapRefinementDiagnostic.agda` records both the
  HEP-R38 gap and the dirty HEP-R39 result. The dirty v2 projection artifact
  `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r39_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `8a11d0962d31ddb52b28256c5469174cf57fce23888f553923af1c21ba6a30ba`,
  projection digest
  `6c19f2eef039b494f8fddc42b8e0941e464adc8fc93e5502f4eadfd04cbc9c3b`,
  and covariance-aware chi2/dof `68.41787311159007`. This is a narrowed
  model-gap diagnostic only: synthetic dirty freeze, no accepted comparison
  law, no empirical adequacy, and no W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.

## 2026-05-04

- add HEP-R38 dirty comparison diagnostic:
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeComparisonDiagnostic.agda` records a covariance-aware
  diagnostic comparison of the dirty HEP-R37 artifact against t44. The current
  finite-trit `sigma_DASHI` construction has chi2 `6402144.431093033`, 18
  degrees of freedom, chi2/dof `355674.6906162796`, residual range
  `0.877355159718522` to `0.9086506463845561`, and first three pulls above
  `1500`. This is a model-gap signal only: dirty artifact, no accepted chi2
  receipt, no comparison law, no empirical adequacy, and no W3/W4/W5/W8
  promotion.
- add HEP-R37 dirty projection-run diagnostic:
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeProjectionRunDiagnostic.agda` records the first
  `sigma_DASHI` t43/t44 diagnostic run. The artifact at
  `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r37_dirty.json` has
  `projectionComplete = true`, 18 bins, file SHA-256
  `aeab81212b9f341f14d2e7147b4fd3dd64f4fa7d78a4c14beabd1518d853229c`, and
  projection digest
  `175c4872bd0db2cf108456c62e4c01295333af3c3aec186f07b4a2832cb4d8a6`.
  The freeze hash is synthetic (`HEP-R37-dirty-diagnostic`) and the worktree is
  dirty, so the run is non-promoting and supplies no accepted projection
  receipt, chi2, comparison law, empirical adequacy, or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R36 `sigma_DASHI` construction surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now exposes a runner-callable
  `DASHI.Physics.Prediction.sigma_dashi:predict_ratio` hook backed by
  deterministic finite trit-state enumeration and a public
  `sigma_DASHI(m_lo, m_hi, phi_lo, phi_hi)` signature. The hook ignores
  observed t43 ratios, uncertainties, and t44 covariance.
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeProjectionReceipt.agda` records the matching
  DashiDynamics/FascisticContraction-backed construction request, EW-depth
  mass-window binding, lambda policy, and non-promotion boundary. HEP-R36 is
  indexed and diagrammed, but clean freeze, projection artifact,
  comparison-law receipt, and W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion remain unconstructed.
- add SIB-MATRIX, HEP-R35, and LILA-R2 count-support surfaces:
  `SiblingMathPortingMatrix.agda` classifies sibling artifacts as
  port-to-Agda, citation-only, diagnostic-only, or ignore-for-closure, with
  dashifine contraction/Lyapunov/seam material as the first port candidates.
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeAPIRouteDiagnostic.agda` records that sibling repos
  and the CSS/Sudakov hook do not supply an accepted `sigma_DASHI` t43
  phi-star ratio API, so DashiDynamics projection construction remains the
  HEP-R35 blocker. `LilaE8RootEnumerationReceiptR2.agda` records the bounded
  `112 + 128 = 240` E8 root-count support surface while preserving the missing
  duplicate-freedom, completeness, norm/inner-product, Weyl-closure, and
  projection-compatibility obligations. All three surfaces are indexed by
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex` and diagrammed as non-promoting.
- add SIB-R1 sibling evidence inventory:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SiblingEvidenceInventory.agda` records useful
  sibling-repo evidence pointers from `dashifine`, `dashiQ`, `dashitest`,
  `DASHIg`, and `dashi_lean4`, then indexes the inventory from
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex`. The surface is explicitly non-promoting: it
  creates no clean freeze, accepted DASHI prediction API, projection receipt,
  comparison law, E8 carrier receipt, Lam-Tung adapter, or W3/W4/W5/W6/W8/W9
  promotion token.
- add SIB-R2 sibling evidence extraction diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SiblingEvidenceExtractionDiagnostic.agda` records
  bounded worker findings from the sibling scan. `dashifine` remains a
  coefficient-flow/proxy diagnostic rather than an accepted phi-star ratio API,
  the Lyapunov output is aggregate support only, the E8 morpheme files are a
  2048-entry tokenizer vocabulary rather than 240 roots, and the Lean files
  support moonshine arithmetic rather than theta/J closure.
- add LILA-R1a through LILA-R5 request surfaces:
  `LilaE8InitialisationPriorNote.agda` records SPUTNIKAI/sovereign-lila-e8 as
  related engineering provenance, rejects AllenAI/Lila as unrelated, and blocks
  LILA-E8 benchmark results from becoming DASHI evidence. `LilaE8RootEnumeration`,
  `LamTungE8AdapterSurface`, and `LilaE8ThetaJBridgeSurface` record R2/R3/R4
  obligations without proving them. `LilaE8PhiStarProjectionReceipt` records
  R5 as parked on accepted R2/R3/R4 receipts and explicitly rejects the
  CSS/Sudakov baseline as the accepted DASHI prediction API. No E8 theorem,
  Lam-Tung adapter, phi-star projection, comparison law, or W3/W4/W5/W8
  promotion is claimed.
- assign HEP-R34 and LILA-R1 parallel lanes:
  `HEPDataResidualBridgeWorkerQueue.agda` now records `Russell` as owner of a
  non-promoting CSS/Sudakov phi-star ratio baseline hook and `Mencius` as
  owner of the local LILA/E8 root-system lattice diagnostic. The HEPData child
  diagram now shows HEP-R34 and LILA-R1 as coordination surfaces only. The
  baseline hook may exercise the runner, but it is not an accepted DASHI
  prediction API, comparison-law receipt, empirical adequacy receipt, or
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R33 phi-star ratio prediction API route diagnostic:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` now actually consumes a supplied
  `--prediction-api module:function` hook, validates that it returns one finite
  ratio per t43 bin, and emits a `projectionComplete = true` projection
  artifact only when that hook succeeds. By default it still exits fail-closed
  with `projectionComplete = false`. `HEPDataT43PredictionAPIRouteDiagnostic.agda`
  records the remaining missing receipt as the accepted DASHI phi-star ratio
  API for `sigma_DASHI(50-76, bin) / sigma_DASHI(76-106, bin)`, not generic
  physics/projection surfaces. No chi2, comparison law, empirical adequacy, or
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion is claimed.
- add HEP-R32 fail-closed t43 projection-runner implementation attempt:
  `HEPDataT43ProjectionRunnerImplementationAttempt.agda` records the concrete
  script lane for `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` and
  `scripts/assert_clean_worktree.sh`, binding it to the verified HEP-R28
  t43/t44 digests and explicitly marking `projectionComplete = false` until a
  real DASHI phi-star ratio prediction function and accepted clean
  `predictionFixedAt` receipt exist. This is executable infrastructure only;
  it does not construct chi2, a comparison law, empirical adequacy, or
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R28 checksum-bound t43/t44 artifact receipt:
  `HEPDataRatioTableArtifactReceipt.agda` records the successful name-based
  HEPData CSV acquisition route for `t43` and `t44`, binds local artifact
  paths and SHA-256 digests, and rejects the short `/t43`, `/t44`, and
  `Table 43` endpoint forms because they returned HEPData error HTML. This
  solves the local artifact checksum prerequisite only; it does not parse the
  CSVs, freeze a prediction, run projection, construct a comparison law, or
  promote W3/W4/W5/W8.
- add HEP-R31 future comparison-law receipt skeleton:
  `HEPDataComparisonLawReceiptRequest.agda` records the requested future
  t43/t44 comparison receipt fields: adapter receipt, projection artifact,
  t43/t44 digests, freeze hash, worktree-clean certificate, chi2, chi2/dof,
  per-bin two-sigma law, and authority DOI. The receipt shape is intentionally
  uninhabited in this lane and does not claim a chi2 result, accepted
  comparison law, empirical adequacy, or W3 promotion.
- add HEP-R30 clean prediction-freeze policy request:
  `HEPDataPredictionFreezePolicyRequest.agda` records the exact supplied
  sequence (`clean via stash/commit`, `rev-parse HEAD`, runner uses that hash)
  plus the worktree-clean certificate shape. It explicitly keeps
  `e137415fe60aa470b9cd41d2357d9494592c0cec` diagnostic-only while the
  worktree is dirty and does not claim an accepted `predictionFixedAt`,
  projection run, artifact digest, or promotion.
- add HEP-R20 through HEP-R23 follow-up receipt surfaces:
  `HEPDataCMSSMP20003ExternalSourceAuthorityReceipt.agda` now treats
  `10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11631-7` as the canonical CMS-SMP-20-003 paper DOI
  and rejects `10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11680-y` as the wrong pointer;
  `HEPDataRatioAdapterTransformReceiptRequest.agda` selects the dimensionless
  `t43/t44` ratio route for `50-76 / 76-106`; and
  `HEPDataPredictionFreezeProjectionRunRequest.agda` records the remaining
  internal `predictionFixedAt` plus DASHI projection-run obligation. The W5/W6
  inventory was expanded to the full consumer-relevant table map while keeping
  all lanes non-promoting.
- add HEP-R24 through HEP-R27 follow-up diagnostics:
  `HEPDataRatioTableArtifactRequest.agda` records the `t43/t44` ratio
  artifact request, now superseded by the HEP-R28 checksum-bound artifacts;
  `HEPDataDASHIProjectionRunnerDiscovery.agda` records that no exact
  digest-bound DASHI t43 projection runner exists; `HEPDataPredictionFreezeIdentityDiagnostic.agda`
  records the current HEAD as diagnostic-only because the dirty worktree blocks
  accepted `predictionFixedAt`; and
  `HEPDataRatioComparisonLawIntakeRequest.agda` records the comparison-law
  intake prerequisites. No empirical adequacy, projection receipt, comparison
  law, or W3 promotion is claimed.
- add HEP-R16 through HEP-R19 follow-up receipt surfaces:
  `HEPDataCMSSMP20003ExternalSourceAuthorityReceipt.agda` records the
  CMS-SMP-20-003 source-authority pointers for `ins2079374`, t19/t20, and
  response matrices t68/t69; this entry was superseded later in the same round
  by HEP-R20, which resolves `11631-7` as canonical and rejects `11680-y`;
  `HEPDataAdapterTransformReceiptRequestDiagnostic.agda` isolates the raw
  t19/t20 versus normalized local artifact adapter-transform gap;
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` names the same-record
  Z-peak, ratio, covariance, and response anchors; and
  `W5W6PhysicsConsumerSourceInventory.agda` inventories high-mass W5 tables and
  W6 theory-adapter candidates with CASCADE TMD first. These are indexed as
  non-promoting request/diagnostic surfaces only; W3, W4, W5, W6, and W8
  remain blocked.
- add the HEPData empirical authority collation/correction packet:
  `HEPDataEmpiricalAuthorityReceiptCollation.agda` records CMS-SMP-20-003
  source metadata, fetched raw HEPData table artifacts, and the
  CMS-SMP-19-010 calibration baseline as a non-promoting receipt collation.
  It corrects the phistar binding to HEPData publication record `ins2079374`,
  `phistar mass 50-76` table DOI `10.17182/hepdata.115656.v1/t19`, and
  covariance table `t20`; the earlier `t31` pointer is rejected for this lane
  because it names a different pT-ratio table. Raw upstream values
  (`228.59 -> 225.69`) and normalized local artifact values
  (`188.4 -> 185.09`) are now explicitly separated, leaving an
  adapter-transform receipt, projection law, comparison law, accepted
  authority route, and W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion open.
- make diagram rendering deterministic:
  `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh` now renders each PlantUML file separately
  for SVG and PNG, avoiding the batch Graphviz failure seen when all docs
  diagrams are passed through one PlantUML process.
- split the oversized worker coordination diagram:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml` is now a compact current-state map, and
  `Docs/HEPDataResidualCoordinationMap.puml` carries the HEP-R1..R33 child
  graph. This preserves the diagram as a renderable coordination surface while
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` remains the full lane-history source.
- wire roadmap gate G4 to W5:
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`, and
  `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now explicitly track `W5` / `Maxwell` as
  the owner of the `W-GR` GR-curvature / GR-QFT completion workstream. This is
  coordination wiring only; no GR/QFT theorem completion, field equation law,
  interaction law, empirical validation, or W5 promotion is claimed.
- add the roadmap to the future target claim:
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md` defines the gated path
  from the current maturity state to a publishable "complete and verified
  physics unification" claim. The roadmap adds G1-G7 gates for canonical spine
  stability, Maxwell/gauge completion, Schrödinger completion, GR curvature /
  GR-QFT completion, empirical validation, cross-lane consistency, and
  publication audit without promoting the current repo state.
- add the physics lane maturity matrix:
  `Docs/PhysicsLaneMaturityMatrix.md` records Maxwell/gauge, Schrödinger,
  GR-curvature, and prediction lanes as present/bridged/packaged but not
  theorem-complete or empirically validated; the physics roadmap diagrams now
  surface the same status without promoting any lane
- add the HEPData residual observable-class external alignment:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassExternalAlignment.agda` maps the internal
  `fluctuationProfile` candidate to the externally legible class
  "adjacent-bin finite-difference residual / local bin-to-bin variation" and
  records the minimal publishable non-collapse statement while preserving the
  missing authority, calibration/covariance, projection, comparison-law, and
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion boundaries
- add the HEPData residual observable-class proto-receipt:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassProtoReceipt.agda` packages the
  `phistar_50_76` residual class candidate as an externalizable
  `residualObservableClassReceipt` payload while proving local intake remains
  rejected at first-missing residual class and the authority gate remains
  blocked; no W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion is constructed
- add the HEPData residual observable-class candidate diagnostic:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassCandidateDiagnostic.agda` specializes the
  residual observable-class request to the local `phistar_50_76` evidence
  pointer as a `fluctuationProfile` under the adjacent-bin local-invariance
  baseline, but still does not construct `residualObservableClassReceipt` or
  promote W3/W4/W5/W8
- add the HEPData external residual witness payload and first local candidate
  diagnostic: `HEPDataExternalResidualWitnessPayload.agda` binds the
  `nonCollapseWitnessReceipt` payload field to the provider/intake/gate
  surfaces without constructing the external receipt, and
  `HEPDataExternalResidualWitnessCandidateDiagnostic.agda` records the
  `phistar_50_76` local evidence pointer, checksums, bin pair, candidate
  residual delta, and first-missing `residualObservableClassReceipt`
- extend the HEPData residual bridge into the explicit receipt-filter core:
  `HEPDataEmpiricalResidualBridgeCore.agda` records the generic residual
  observable, baseline/invariance, non-collapse witness, defect projection, and
  residual-to-defect comparison-soundness shape; `HEPDataResidualProviderPayloadIntake.agda`
  records provider payload fields and canonical first-missing intake outcomes;
  and `HEPDataResidualBridgeAuthorityGate.agda` accepts only a full residual
  receipt chain or first-missing typed diagnostic while rejecting raw/path /
  unchecksumed/no-route/no-witness provider answers. These remain
  non-promoting and are indexed from the P0 provider/blocker surfaces.
- add the HEPData residual/deviation retarget round:
  `HEPDataResidualBridgeWorkerQueue.agda` records HEP-R1..R3 assignments,
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassRequest.agda` requires residual/deviation /
  anomaly / symmetry-breaking / defect-profile observable classes instead of
  raw saturated values, `HEPDataDefectProjectionDiagnostic.agda` retargets the
  theorem-side bridge to DASHI defect/residual profiles and blocks raw/constant
  projections, and `HEPDataResidualSourceCandidateDiagnostic.agda` inventories
  local residual-like HEPData artifacts without treating them as accepted
  receipts
- extend the HEPData residual retarget into provider-ready receipt surfaces:
  `HEPDataResidualProviderReceiptRequestPack.agda` consolidates HEP-R1/R2/R3
  under a first-missing residual receipt policy,
  `HEPDataNonCollapseObservableObligation.agda` names the external witness
  required to prove a selected residual observable is non-collapsing, and
  `HEPDataResidualComparisonLawRequest.agda` narrows comparison to residual
  modes such as sign pattern, normalized pull, covariance-whitened distance,
  defect-class match, or anomaly ranking
- extend `HEPDataProviderReceiptRequestPack.agda` and
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` so residual/deviation observable-class and
  DASHI defect-projection receipts are first-class non-promoting HEPData bridge
  requirements; W3, W4, W5, and W8 remain externally blocked
- add `HEPDataEmpiricalSourceCandidateDiagnostic.agda` and index it from
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda`, recording that local HEPData /
  `MeasurementSurface` source candidates exist while the accepted empirical
  bridge still lacks `HEPDataObservable` schema/checksum, physical-observable
  / table-column selection, units, calibration, comparison law,
  `MeasurementSurface -> DashiState` projection, metric propagation,
  HEPData-to-ITIR authority adapter, W3 accepted authority, and W8
  origin-promotion receipts
- update `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`,
  `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so the next empirical workers target a concrete
  `DASHI observable -> HEPData observable` bridge or typed projection
  rejection, rather than another raw data-source search
- add the next HEPData bridge round:
  `HEPDataBridgeWorkerQueue.agda` assigns HEP-A through HEP-F,
  `HEPDataObservableSchema.agda` defines the schema/checksum request surface,
  `HEPDataObservableSelectionDiagnostic.agda` records the blocked observable /
  table-column selection gate, `HEPDataUnitCalibrationRequirementDiagnostic.agda`
  records the unit/dimension/calibration receipt requirements,
  `HEPDataMeasurementSurfaceProjectionRejection.agda` records the current
  `MeasurementSurface -> DashiState` boundary as a typed rejection, and
  `HEPDataComparisonAuthorityRouteDiagnostic.agda` records the comparison-law
  and accepted dataset authority route as blocked future receipt shapes before
  `HEPDataITIRAuthorityAdapterDiagnostic.agda` records that generic ITIR
  provenance scaffolding exists but no HEPData-specific authority adapter/token
  is present; all four are indexed as non-promoting coordination/diagnostic
  surfaces
- add `HEPDataProviderReceiptRequestPack.agda` as the consolidated HEPData
  provider-facing receipt pack and index it from the P0 provider/blocker
  surfaces. The pack co-locates the observable schema, selection receipt,
  unit-calibration receipt, theorem-side projection receipt, ITIR
  authority-adapter receipt, comparison-law receipt, accepted dataset authority
  token, and accepted route, while constructing none of them.
- record the active W1-W4 theorem/bridge assignment round in
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`,
  `README.md`, and `TODO.md`: `W1`=`Erdos`, `W2`=`Boole`, `W3`=`Tesla`,
  `W4`=`Poincare`
- integrate the W1-W4 worker results:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCurrentCarrierObstruction.agda` sharpens W1 by
  proving the current carriers do not close both MDL alignment legs;
  `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem.agda` now carries a finite shift-flow
  `P0.ConvergenceBound`; `EmpiricalAdequacyCarrierDiagnostic.agda` records the
  narrow packaged empirical equality plus full-profile mismatch; and
  `ChemistryRightLimitsQuotientCrossBandCouplingRequirement.agda` now carries
  a symmetric, quotient-sensitive, diagonal-nontrivial Candidate256 law surface
- refine the W4 symmetry statement:
  `ChemistryRightLimitsQuotientCrossBandCouplingRequirement.agda` now defines
  a simultaneous sheet-sign reversal involution and proves the cross-band
  coupling kernel is invariant under that reversal, making the W4 symmetry
  gate native to the structural trit/lattice representation rather than an
  external temporal/provenance predicate
- keep the dependency rule explicit: `W1` is the carrier-critical blocker for
  full `W3` empirical equality and `W4` carrier promotion, while `W2` remains
  partially independent but affects convergence checkability
- preserve the governance boundary: the assignment round is coordination only
  and does not discharge any red/yellow blocker without targeted Agda or a
  typed mismatch diagnostic
- start a bounded follow-up round: `W1b` stays with `Erdos` for a
  replacement/retargeted MDL channel or typed next-ingredient diagnostic, and
  `W2b` stays with `Boole` for a realization-independent metric/horizon
  convergence target; `W3` and `W4` are parked until carrier/channel inputs
  change
- integrate that follow-up round:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetedChannel.agda` now names the
  transported schedule MDL readout as a retargeted noncanonical channel, and
  `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem.agda` now carries a local
  `PointedMetricHorizonConvergenceTarget`; both remain guarded against full
  promotion until the retargeted-channel policy/theorem and realization-family
  metric coherence exist
- integrate the dependency-reduction round:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetedChannel.agda` now exposes
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyAssumption` and
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyAccepted`, while
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlNextIngredientGap.agda` names the required
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyIngredient`; this makes the W1
  retarget-policy gate typed without asserting that the old current carrier is
  CR-flat or that repo policy has already accepted the retargeted target
- extend `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem.agda` with
  `RealizationIndexedPointedMetricConvergenceTarget` and
  `canonicalShiftRealizationMetricConvergenceFamily`, giving W2 a nontrivial
  realization-tagged shift-flow metric/horizon/rate witness while keeping the
  wider natural/`p2` theorem boundary explicit
- add a conservative W8 origin-observation receipt surface:
  `P0BlockadeProofObligations.agda` now defines `EmpiricalReceiptStatus` and
  `OriginObservationReceipt`, and `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` records
  that this names carrier transport, origin observation map, signature owner,
  dynamics witness, empirical status/caution, and CRT/J bridge without
  promoting empirical adequacy, convergence, or seam closure
- formalize the W3 meaning of `mismatch diagnostic`:
  `P0BlockadeProofObligations.agda` now defines trits, trit-level mismatch
  kinds, the five F-component causes, and `MismatchDiagnostic`; W3 now records
  structured diagnostics for the chi2 pool, chi2 tail lift, B4 standalone
  status, full-profile universe mismatch, and missing origin observation map.
  Reader docs now state that a bare inequality is not an admissible diagnostic.
- assign the targeted dependency round:
  `Bernoulli` owns `W8b` for an origin-observation receipt instance or typed
  missing-field diagnostic, and `Hubble` owns `W3b` for the B4 empirical
  dependency clarification. `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`,
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`, `README.md`, and `TODO.md` now record
  that the `W1` retarget-policy ingredient remains governance-parked rather
  than worker-inhabited.
- integrate the targeted dependency round:
  `MinimalCredibleShiftOriginObservation.agda` now instantiates a concrete
  non-promoting `OriginObservationReceipt` for `minimumCredibleClosureShift`,
  marks it `empiricalBlocked`, and exposes
  `missingEmpiricalAdequacyBridge`; `EmpiricalAdequacyCarrierDiagnostic.agda`
  now carries `B4EmpiricalDependencyReceipt`, making the B4 closure/observable
  promotion bridge separate from the empirical B4 shell-validation blocker.
- add the W1d retarget-policy decision:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlRetargetPolicyDecision.agda` accepts exactly the
  canonical retargeted schedule-MDL channel by equality, inhabits
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyIngredient`, and produces
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyAccepted` without asserting that
  the old current noncanonical carrier is CR-flat.
- integrate the W3c/W4c policy-consumption results:
  `EmpiricalAdequacyCarrierDiagnostic.agda` now consumes the W1d policy decision
  and W8b origin receipt while keeping the origin side `empiricalBlocked`, and
  `ChemistryPhysicalHandoffDiagnostic.agda` records the accepted-carrier
  Candidate256 quotient/cross-band pre-handoff with status
  `missingPhysicalConsumer`.
- start the remainder-narrowing round:
  `Carson` owns `W3d` for chi2 fixed-point carrier transport or a sharper typed
  obstruction, and `Ptolemy` owns `W4d` for a physical-consumer surface or
  sharper missing-ingredient diagnostic.
- integrate the remainder-narrowing results:
  `Chi2FixedPointCarrierTransportObstruction.agda` names the positive
  `Chi2FixedPointCarrierTransportReceipt` and records the current
  `blockedByPoolMismatchAndNoSameSurface` obstruction, while
  `ChemistryPhysicalHandoffDiagnostic.agda` now sharpens W4's missing consumer
  to `missingRetargetedQuotientInterpretationCarrierOrPreservationLaw`.
- start the dual-discharge attempt round:
  `Carver` owns `W3e` for the chi2 same-surface / fixed-point
  defect-observation receipt, and `Darwin` owns `W4e` for the retargeted
  quotient physical interpretation carrier/preservation law.
- integrate the dual-discharge results:
  `Chi2FixedPointCarrierTransportObstruction.agda` now inhabits the chi2
  transport receipt but records it as `carrierForgettingConstantReceiptOnly`,
  and `ChemistryPhysicalHandoffDiagnostic.agda` now inhabits a boundary-only
  `canonicalRetargetedQuotientChemistryPhysicalConsumer` with status
  `retargetedQuotientPrePhysicalConsumerAvailable`.
- integrate the blocker-tightening results:
  `Chi2NonForgettingSameSurfaceObstruction.agda` records that the current
  same-`Nat` defect target cannot also distinguish primary/secondary chi2
  cases, and `ChemistryStrictPhysicalSemanticsBlocker.agda` records the strict
  physical semantics gap as missing scale-setting, spectral observable,
  bonding, and empirical physical validation ingredients.
- integrate the obligation-surfacing results:
  `Chi2CanonicalPoolObservationCandidate.agda` adds a local nonconstant chi2
  pool discriminator that remains non-empirical and non-promoting, and
  `W4StrictPhysicalNextObligation.agda` packages the strict Candidate256
  physical handoff fields as obligations-needed rather than inhabited theorem
  claims.
- integrate the local-transport/ledger results:
  `Chi2ToShiftPressureTransportCandidate.agda` maps the local chi2 pool onto
  the start/next/held shift-pressure carrier with pairwise distinction while
  refusing fixed-point empirical adequacy, and
  `W4StrictPhysicalObligationLedger.agda` orders the strict Candidate256
  physical lanes with scale-setting first.
- add the W3 local-dynamics bridge:
  `Chi2TransportDynamicsToFixedPointBridge.agda` composes the local chi2
  transport with the existing two-step shift absorption theorem, leaving only
  empirical observation target and promotion bridge work for that local W3
  path.
- add the W3/W4 obligation-narrowing surfaces:
  `W3EmpiricalTargetPromotionBridgeObligation.agda` packages the remaining W3
  empirical target/promotion obligations, and
  `W4StrictPhysicalScaleSettingLaneObligation.agda` narrows the first strict
  physical Candidate256 lane to scale carrier, quotient-class scale map, and
  `L_chem` scale-preservation law requirements.
- add the W3/W4 surrogate-boundary surfaces:
  `W3SurrogateEmpiricalTargetBoundary.agda` inhabits the W3 target/promotion
  shape with a synthetic non-authoritative target, and
  `W4SurrogateScaleSettingBoundary.agda` inhabits the scale-setting shape with
  a dimensionless `Nat` diagonal while preserving the physical
  units/calibration blocker.
- add the W3/W4 authority and calibration gates:
  `W3AcceptedEmpiricalAuthorityGate.agda` records that current photonuclear
  evidence remains empirical-only while B4 and origin promotions are blocked,
  and `W4PhysicalCalibrationGate.agda` records that the dimensionless scale
  surrogate still needs physical units, calibration, and dimensional
  preservation before scale-setting promotion.
- harden those W3/W4 gates:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` and
  `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationAuthorityToken` are constructorless in the
  current repo, preventing the synthetic W3 target or dimensionless W4 `Nat`
  scale surrogate from accidentally promoting without a new upstream authority
  receipt.
- add external-intake obligation surfaces for the hardened gates:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceiptObligation.agda` names the external
  accepted-evidence authority receipt shape needed to combine authority,
  evidence-backed target, B4 empirical promotion, and origin promotion, while
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceiptObligation.agda` names the external
  physical-calibration receipt shape needed for units, calibration,
  factorization, and dimensional preservation. Both record current status as
  blocked/obligations-needed only.
- add next-obligation surfaces for the remaining open lanes:
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligation.agda` records W5 downstream GR/QFT consumer
  fields with a constructorless promotion authority token,
  `DASHI/Interop/PNFResidualConsumerNextObligation.agda` records W6
  receipt-backed ITIR/PNF residual consumer requirements without labels by
  inspection, and `CancellationPressureCompatibilityNextObligation.agda`
  records W9's existing pressure-witness route plus the weighted-valuation
  replacement seam.
- add final-boundary obligation surfaces for the remaining coordination lanes:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlRetargetFinalSeamObligation.agda` records W1's
  final retargeted-seam receipt and handoff requirements,
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda` records W2's broader
  natural/p2 promotion requirements beyond the shift-flow convergence
  receipts, `ClaimGovernancePromotionObligation.agda` records W7 authority and
  validation requirements for guarded chart readings, and
  `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalObligation.agda` records W8's external
  promotion receipt requirements while keeping the current origin receipt
  `empiricalBlocked`.
- add a board-wide P0 obligation index:
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` imports the current W1-W9 obligation/status
  surfaces as a single targeted smoke-check module for worker coordination and
  discoverability. It is explicitly non-promoting and does not inhabit external
  authority, calibration, empirical, origin, GR/QFT, PNF, natural, or
  cancellation-pressure receipts.
- add route-narrowing queue surfaces:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityRouteNarrowing.agda` names the accepted-authority route
  and current constructorless-token blockers for W3,
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationRouteNarrowing.agda` narrows W4 to physical units,
  Nat-to-unit calibration, quotient-scale factorization, dimensional
  preservation, and validation, and `P0SecondaryObligationQueue.agda` co-locates
  W5/W6/W9 current obligation statuses. `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` now
  imports these route surfaces without promoting any lane.
- record the current coordination plateau:
  after the route-narrowing queue round, the next admissible work for W3, W4,
  W5, W6, W8, and W9 requires external authority, calibration, empirical,
  runtime, origin-promotion, or pressure-witness receipts rather than another
  local surrogate-promotion worker.
- add a unified energy-functional coordination surface:
  `UnifiedEnergyFunctionalSurface.agda` records the already-present Lyapunov
  skeleton across UFTC severity max-propagation, strict-contraction
  distance-to-fixed-point descent, finite shift quadratic energy, and
  `JFixedPoint` normalization to `196884`. `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda`
  imports the surface as a smoke target, but this does not merge carriers or
  promote external empirical, physical-calibration, runtime, origin, or
  pressure receipts.
- add a receipt-driven blocker-kill matrix:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` records W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, W8, and W9 as
  typed kill conditions with receipt, authority/evidence wrappers, no-bypass
  laws, and an `unblocked` promotion target once the relevant receipt exists.
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` imports the matrix, but no missing receipt
  or authority/calibration token is constructed.
- assign the receipt-kill parallel lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml` now
  route `Noether`, `Turing`, `Curie-W3`, `Faraday`, `Maxwell`, `Liskov`,
  `Hypatia`, and `Planck` to the W1/W2/W3/W4/W5/W6/W8/W9 kill-condition
  receipts respectively. The assignment is parallel and receipt-driven; no
  lane is promoted by assignment alone.
- integrate the receipt-kill parallel lane results:
  W1 landed the final retargeted seam receipt and pre-physical handoff
  compatibility, and `BlockerKillConditions.w1KillCondition` now marks that
  final-seam kill condition as `unblocked` without reviving the old carrier;
  W2/W3/W4/W5 sharpened
  constructorless-token or missing receipt-field diagnostics; W6 added a
  runtime-evidence constructor for `PNFResidualConsumerReceipt`; W8 discharged
  origin-map compatibility and closure-boundary preservation while keeping
  empirical status blocked; and W9 added a weighted cancellation-pressure
  candidate receipt, then proved the current uniform
  cancellation-to-weighted-quadratic identification impossible at `(1 , 1)`,
  leaving W9 blocked on the existing pressure-witness route or a different
  replacement seam.
- integrate the receipt-kill follow-up round:
  Hopper/W6 added the explicit runtime-intake request surface for supplied
  consumer profile/id, paired runtime `PNFEmissionReceipt`s, and Hecke
  candidate-pool receipt id; Emmy/W8 added an externally gated promoted-status
  receipt shape while preserving `empiricalBlocked`; and Dirichlet/W9 proved
  the existing pressure-witness route obstructed for canonical-15 at `(1 , 3)`,
  leaving W9 dependent on a narrowed theorem family or different
  pressure-compatible quadratic target.
- integrate the receipt-source and route-selection round:
  Ada/W6 added a runtime receipt-source diagnostic showing no concrete in-repo
  runtime values satisfy the intake request; Gauss/W8 added an origin authority
  source diagnostic eliminating self-promotion and naming the missing external
  authority or origin adequacy bridge; and Riemann/W9 recorded current route
  exhaustion plus the next pressure-compatible retarget boundary, explicitly
  without claiming canonical Qcore promotion.
- integrate the external bridge split round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeObservable.agda` adds the Option A
  `E_total -> simple observable` surface while keeping measured values and
  empirical authority external; `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeUnits.agda` adds the
  Option B unit/dimension-preserving calibration surface while keeping numeric
  calibration authority constructorless; and
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeToyFit.agda` adds the Option C finite toy-fit
  surface while preventing toy adequacy from promoting W3/W8 empirical
  authority. `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda`, the worker board, and the worker
  map now index these as non-promoting bridge interfaces.
- integrate the intake and retarget round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeObservableIntake.agda` names the exact external
  measured-value / witness / authority-token / match-proof receipt needed for
  Option A; `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeUnitsIntake.agda` names the unit,
  dimension, calibration, monotonicity, authority, and validation receipt plus
  `intakeReceiptToBridge` for Option B; and
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeToyFitAuthorityBoundary.agda` keeps finite toy-fit
  adequacy non-authoritative while routing real dataset evidence through W3/W8
  receipts. `CancellationPressureCompatibilityNextObligation.agda` now carries
  `PressureCompatibleTargetWithQcoreBoundaryReceipt` and
  `canonicalPairPressureRetargetReceipt`, landing the selected W9 retarget route
  with an explicit non-Qcore boundary and no `CancellationPressureCompatibility`
  or admissible-quadratic promotion.
- integrate the source diagnostic and consumer-obligation round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeObservableSourceDiagnostic.agda` records all
  Option A external measured-observable intake fields as missing;
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeUnitsSourceDiagnostic.agda` records all Option B
  unit-calibration source inputs as missing; and
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeToyFitRealDatasetRouteDiagnostic.agda` records the
  real-dataset route as blocked on W3 external authority, W3 positive route, and
  W8 origin promotion receipts. `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerObligation.agda`
  names the downstream consumer acceptance receipt required before
  `canonicalPairPressureRetargetReceipt` can route around
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`, preserving non-Qcore and no-admissible-
  quadratic-promotion boundaries.
- integrate the external request / source handoff round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` consolidates the
  A3/B3/C3 missing external receipt fields into a provider-facing request pack;
  `GRQFTConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` records that W5 has bounded known-limits
  bridge sources but lacks promotion authority, laws, witnesses, downstream
  fields, and empirical validation;
  `PNFResidualConsumerReceiptRequestPack.agda` co-locates W6 runtime payload
  fields without fabricating receipts or labels; and
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` records that W9
  still lacks a retarget consumer interface and acceptance receipt. The P0
  index, worker board, and worker map now include these non-promoting handoff
  surfaces.
- integrate the provider request-pack round:
  `GRQFTClosurePromotionReceiptRequestPack.agda` packages the exact W5
  closure-promotion provider payload; `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalRequestPack.agda`
  packages the exact W8 origin-promotion external receipt payload; and
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerAcceptanceRequestPack.agda` packages the
  exact W9 retarget consumer interface and acceptance receipt artifacts. The
  P0 index, worker board, and worker map now include these as non-promoting
  provider-facing request packs.
- sharpen the W9 dim-15 pressure obstruction:
  `CancellationPressureCompatibilityNextObligation.agda` now exposes
  `canonical15WeightedReplacementCandidateReceipt` and
  `canonical15DeltaToQuadraticClosureObstruction`, packaging the canonical
  `(1 , 3)` pressure-witness failure, the `(1 , 1)` weighted uniform
  identification failure, and the selected pressure-compatible retarget's
  non-Qcore boundary. `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerAcceptanceRequestPack.agda`
  threads that typed obstruction into the provider handoff without constructing
  a `W9KillReceipt`, admissible quadratic promotion, or
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`.
- integrate the empirical / calibration request-pack round:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` packages the exact W3
  accepted-authority external receipt payload, and
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` packages the exact W4
  Candidate256 physical-calibration receipt payload. Both are indexed and
  diagrammed as provider-facing request packs only, with no empirical
  authority, B4/origin promotion, calibration authority, physical unit system,
  dimensional law, or physical validation constructed.
- add the provider request-pack index:
  `P0ProviderReceiptRequestIndex.agda` co-locates the A/B/C, W3, W4, W5, W6,
  W8, and W9 provider-facing request packs in one typed handoff surface. The P0
  blocker index imports it, but no provider receipt or promotion is constructed.
- integrate the provider attempt diagnostic round:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityProviderAttempt.agda` records that current W3 sources
  cannot construct an accepted-authority external receipt;
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationProviderAttempt.agda` records that current W4 sources
  cannot construct a Candidate256 physical-calibration receipt; and
  `PNFResidualConsumerRuntimeProviderAttempt.agda` records that current W6
  sources expose constructors/builders but still lack the concrete runtime
  payload. The P0 blocker index imports all three diagnostics without
  promoting any provider lane.
- integrate the empirical compatibility provider-attempt round:
  `EmpiricalCompatibilityOptionAProviderAttempt.agda`,
  `EmpiricalCompatibilityOptionBProviderAttempt.agda`, and
  `EmpiricalCompatibilityOptionCProviderAttempt.agda` record diagnostic-only
  attempts for measured-observable, unit-calibration, and real-dataset
  authority routes. All three are indexed as non-promoting evidence that
  empirical compatibility remains uninhabited until external measurement,
  calibration, authority, validation, W3, and W8 receipts arrive.

## 2026-05-03

- add a worker coordination surface for active diagram blockers.
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`
  now translate the main roadmap blocker boxes into lane IDs `W0` through `W9`
  with owner labels, primary file surfaces, success conditions, and validation
  rules. `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, the
  autonomous-execution docs, and the main diagrams now route parallel workers
  through the board and explicitly mark the old closure checklist as
  historical/provenance. This is docs-only coordination; no theorem or blocker
  was discharged.

## 2026-05-02

- add spacetime-sheaf / mereological-space proof obligations and guardrails.
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.TemporalSheafProofObligations` now also names the
  minimal Agda record surfaces for spacetime sections over `(Time, Space)`,
  mereological containment, spatial overlap, spacetime gluing,
  exclusive-coordinate uniqueness, Cauchy-style slice evolution, and
  `JFixedPoint` spacetime-transition obstruction. `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`,
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now state that spacetime, 3+1,
  Cauchy-surface, spacetime-density-matrix, or singularity readings remain
  proof obligations until typed carriers, gluing laws, evolution preservation,
  and transition-obstruction witnesses exist.
- add temporal-sheaf / time-indexed state proof obligations and guardrails.
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.TemporalSheafProofObligations` now names the minimal
  Agda record surfaces for time-indexed sections, overlap compatibility,
  `MereViol` non-gluability, exclusive-property single-valued fibres,
  `JFixedPoint`/`+1` topology-transition obligations, and temporal section
  metrics. `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`,
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`, `README.md`,
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md`, and `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` now
  state that temporal qualifiers are not promoted into sheaves, topology
  changes, or ultrametric section distances without typed carriers,
  gluing/restriction laws, transition witnesses, and validation.
- add neurochemical / body-brain-chemistry guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `README.md`, and `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now treat
  synaptic/electrical, volume-transmission, endocrine/hormonal, and epigenetic
  or cultural propagation readings as biomedical cross-scale fixtures only.
  Promotion of GABA, glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, oxytocin,
  cortisol, insulin, acetylcholine, allostatic load, receptor-context,
  body:brain:chemistry, or Base369-biological identity language now requires
  typed biological carriers, receptor/context models, biomarker measurement
  protocols, causal hypotheses, biomedical validation, and clinical
  non-authority flags.
- add market self-observation / trader-operator guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `README.md`, and `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now treat
  trader-as-node, market-as-RG-stack, operator-trading psychology,
  three-conjunct signal architecture, MDL market compression, and
  `JFixedPoint trade` language as hypothesis fixtures only. Promotion to a
  market signal requires typed trader-state receipts, market-data receipts,
  cross-scale maps, execution/risk/cost/compliance rules, period/regime-change
  definitions where claimed, and out-of-sample validation. The main roadmap
  diagrams now include this as a claim-governance boundary, not a theorem lane.
- add the minimal P0 blocker proof-obligation interface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/P0BlockadeProofObligations.agda` now defines the
  small record surfaces for MDL seam, finite convergence bound, empirical
  adequacy, p2 bridge or admissible-candidate obstruction, chemistry law,
  explicit field seam, realization independence, and origin receipt. The module
  is imported by `DASHI/Everything.agda` and typechecks standalone. This is an
  obligation surface only; it does not discharge the concrete blocker lanes.
- refresh diagram claim-governance coverage for the latest comparative-formalism
  additions.
  `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`, and
  `Docs/RepoMetasystem.puml` now expose the mathematical-atlas /
  higher-structure and cross-scale physics/biology/consciousness guardrails as
  explicit diagram nodes. The canonical proof spine remains unchanged because
  these are hypothesis-governance surfaces, not theorem-owner promotions.
- add cross-scale physics / biology / consciousness guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now state that quantum, QFT/RG,
  thermodynamic, chemical, molecular-biology, epigenetic, neuroscience,
  affective, theological, and consciousness readings are scale-unification
  fixtures, not current theorem claims. They require typed carriers at each
  scale, explicit scale maps, observable-preservation laws, measurement
  protocols, empirical validation, and clinical non-authority flags before
  projector/unitary, RG relevance, Landauer erasure, phase transition,
  correlation length, DNA eigenclass, epigenetic Dreaming-layer,
  predictive-processing, polyvagal/Base369, IIT Phi, or `JFixedPoint` claims
  are emitted.
- add mathematical-atlas / higher-structure guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now state that category-theory,
  Jain-topos, HoTT, ergodic, information-geometric, coinductive /
  non-well-founded, tropical, renormalization, and infinity-categorical
  readings are future chart languages, not current theorem claims. They require
  typed chart carriers, morphisms from receipted PNF/residual/operator
  surfaces, preservation laws, and validation before adjunction,
  subobject-classifier, path-identity, scan-order, Fisher/MDL, hyperset,
  tropical-limit, RG relevance, infinity-topos, terminal-object, Monster, or
  `JFixedPoint` claims are emitted.
- add affective-state / feelings-wheel guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, and `README.md` now state that emotion
  wheel, vedana/sankhara, mindfulness-labeling, affective-collapse, trauma,
  PTSD, healing, high-Mana, Dreaming-centre, and personal-DASHI fixtures
  require a named affective taxonomy, source or subject/session receipts,
  psychometric or clinical validation status, contemplative-source profiles
  where relevant, typed tone/naming/perspective/wrapper carriers, and explicit
  clinical non-authority flags before Base369, Whakapapa, DharmaSystem,
  Amalek-collapse, treatment, diagnosis, or `JFixedPoint` claims are emitted.
- add East Asian / Indigenous living-lattice guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, and `README.md` now state that Taoist,
  Confucian, Shinto, Indigenous American, Maori, Aboriginal Australian, and
  broader living-lattice fixtures require culturally governed public receipts,
  place/community provenance where applicable, restricted-knowledge flags,
  topology-changing carrier definitions, relation/flow/graph/bundle/derivation
  rules, typed morphisms, and validation before carrier-substrate,
  natural-flow, relation-matrix, immanent-node, fully connected,
  derivation-graph, timeless-bundle, songline/scan-order, metric,
  `JFixedPoint`, or empirical-proof claims are emitted.
- add non-Abrahamic / N-body comparative-lattice guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, and `README.md` now state that Hindu,
  Buddhist, Jain, and broader non-Abrahamic comparative fixtures require
  school-level source receipts, interpretive-profile metadata, carrier
  definitions, role-binding or process translations, perspective/action
  semantics where relevant, typed morphisms into or away from PNF, and
  validation before identity-map, permanent-distance, telos-free action,
  process-dissolution, perspective-indexed, `JFixedPoint`, or universal
  terminus claims are emitted.
- add conditional-trigger / latent fixed-point guardrails for classifier
  fixtures.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`,
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`, and
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md` now state that terminal-looking traces
  may be modelled as triggered responses only after emitted trigger receipts,
  modality/qualifier rules, a trigger connective, deactivation semantics,
  latent fixed-point witness, and convergence theorem exist.
- add aggressor / responsibility-label guardrails for classifier fixtures.
  The same docs now state that ordinary aggressor labels require a shared-fibre
  PNF taxonomy, while incommensurable-operator responsibility labels require a
  cross-fibre responsibility taxonomy, cost/threat/response receipts,
  third-party burden provenance where relevant, and external validation.
- add existential-fibre / multi-domain operator-completeness guardrails.
  The same docs now state that existential-domain fixtures are separate from
  economic and theological fibres, requiring physical-survival witness
  receipts, source provenance, temporal/wrapper/modality fields, a
  warrant-ordering rule if domains are ranked, and a typed multi-domain
  interaction operator before operator-completeness or triple-domain claims are
  emitted.
- add enemy-classification operator guardrails.
  The same docs now state that lineage-fixed versus behaviour-conditional
  classifier claims require textual/source-span receipts, interpretive-profile
  metadata, classifier-input taxonomy, inverse/deactivation semantics, and
  validation before they can be compared with operator-duality or contraction
  surfaces.
- add collapsed-quotient / no-typed-meet guardrails.
  The classifier docs now state that a collapsed one-element or coarser
  lattice is well-formed inside the residual formalism. Cross-carrier
  comparison yields `noTypedMeet` unless an explicit product lattice or
  lift/redifferentiation model is supplied; quotient maps and lost-distinction
  records are required before impassability or resolution claims are emitted.
- add protected-identity / conduct-axis and three-body lattice guardrails.
  The classifier docs now state that two-axis and three-component lattice
  fixtures require role-binding taxonomies, component meet/join laws,
  product-lattice maps, projection/quotient/lift maps, decision-operator
  routing, decoupling rules where claimed, source receipts, and validation
  before any named legal/theological/historical system is classified.
- add hostile-provenance / four-body theology guardrails.
  The classifier docs now state that Basilides/Gnostic/Sufi/heresiological or
  infographic fixtures require source-critical receipts, adversarial/indirect
  witness qualifiers, orientation maps, product-lattice definitions, operator
  witnesses, and validation before any direct-doctrine, CRT/JFixedPoint,
  operator-duality, or current-conflict algebra claim is emitted. The docs also
  correct the missing-`Ultrametric` phrasing: the module exists; the missing
  ingredient would be a domain-specific theological-lattice metric.
- add Base369-chain / algebraic-lift guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `Docs/CoreSpineBridge.md`, and
  `Docs/CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md` now distinguish the rigorous
  Tri/Hex/Nonary cyclic-carrier surface from proposed theological,
  actor-count, Theta, strategy-window, resolution-condition, or global
  attractor semantics, which require typed carrier maps, commutation/seam
  proofs, operator witnesses, and validation.

## 2026-05-01

- add the normalized claim-comparison engine surface.
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md` now records the repo-accurate chain from
  runtime PNF emission through `PNFEmissionReceipt`, `receiptResidual`,
  residual join laws, UFTC/DASHI pressure, tetralemma/sixfold carrier bridges,
  and `Ontology.Hecke.PNFResidualBridge`. It explicitly separates runtime
  emission from compiled residual algebra, corrects the stale
  `Ultrametric.agda` blocker claim, and names the remaining promotion gates.
  It now also records already-formal formula spans and attribution-by-response
  interview exchanges as conditional trace fixtures: useful test surfaces, but
  valid only after parser/reducer/formula-reader receipts emit typed atoms.
  It also now records the operator-level sufficient-statistic pattern for
  formula fixtures: a formula-reader receipt may emit a local-expansion
  hypothesis such as `f (f x) > f x`, but that does not prove a market period,
  actor classification, or real-world `AntiFascistSystem` instance without a
  separate model witness for the carrier, operator, observable, and
  obligations.
  It now also records the domain-incommensurability deterrence fixture: a
  formula can fail as deterrence if the target decision domain has no emitted
  measure bridge to the formula's cost domain. This is documented as an open
  design gate, not as a compiled residual constructor or a hand-assigned label
  for any live corpus.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md` now records the downstream
  attractor/orbit classifier design over receipted residual, wrapper, domain,
  formula, and Hecke features. It keeps market-risk use behind empirical
  validation and hidden-operator inference behind causal/provenance validation;
  no trading signal, price floor, or causal-source attribution is claimed.
  It now also records the state-operator / political-label boundary:
  per-domain operator traces may support composite hypotheses only after
  receipts and feature extraction exist, while live state political labels
  require a separate taxonomy, receipt corpus, scope rule, and validation
  standard. `FascisticSystem` remains a formal entropy-collapsing projection
  property, not a direct political classification.
  It now also records the relational pair-operator boundary: an interaction
  claim over `S_left x S_right` needs directed receipts, a product carrier,
  coupling/composition law, and a joint convergence/non-convergence theorem
  before component trace labels can imply a joint fixed point, no-fixed-point
  result, terminal dominance, or operator-level sufficient statistic.
  It now also records the bot/source join-domain boundary: market-risk and
  causal-source readings can share a receipted feature stream, but exactness
  requires a typed observation map, orbit-input bijectivity or canonical
  representative theorem, a minimal-operator relation, and empirical/causal
  validation. `CRTPeriod` remains recurrence, not an injective classifier
  horizon, and `JFixedPoint` is not a trading convergence or source-selection
  certificate.
  It now also records the global phase-space / bifurcation boundary:
  capitalism/socialism/theology/reactive-operator labels are design fixtures,
  not theorem claims, until a global state carrier, basin metric, perturbation
  threshold, typed epistemic interaction operator, and validation standard are
  supplied. `s-mono` remains monotone severity aggregation; it does not by
  itself prove global reactive Jacobian dynamics or basin exit.
- add the PNF wrapper case-study boundary.
  `DASHI.Interop.SensibLawResidualLattice` now has
  `performativeEvidence` as a wrapper state, records that it mismatches
  `directEvidence`, and projects it to `scopeExceeded6` in the six-level
  residual carrier. It also now names `PNFEmissionReceipt` and
  `receiptResidual`, so text-side residual comparison is explicitly driven by
  parser/reducer/source-span receipts rather than analyst-assigned labels.
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md` documents Watergate as a closed
  evidence-corpus pattern and the current Iran-war rhetoric example as a live
  corpus fixture, with external reporting treated only as source-span context.
  The note now explicitly rejects hand-assigned wrapper, qualifier, role,
  signature, or residual labels.
- add the Hecke PNF residual fibre adapter.
  `Ontology.Hecke.PNFResidualBridge` now maps coarse Hecke defect classes into
  the PNF residual chain (`stable -> partial`, `illegal -> contradiction`,
  `other -> noTypedMeet`), proves illegal defects remain contradiction /
  critical pressure under joins, records the canonical saturated histogram as
  `partial`, and exposes quotient projection equality as the
  `SameHeckeCandidatePool` fibre over `QuotientInterfaceOn`.
- add ITIR PNF / residual logic carrier bridges.
  `DASHI.Interop.SensibLawResidualLattice` now formalizes the four residual
  levels as a join-semilattice, maps residual joins into DASHI pressure, and
  defines a signature-fibred `PredicatePNF` carrier shape without parser
  semantics. It also records wrapper gating, predicate-index fallback,
  `SixResidualLevel`, `hexToSixResidual`, non-wrap severity transport, the
  hex wrap seam, and six-level join/pressure preservation.
  `DASHI.Algebra.TetralemmaBridge` aligns `LogicTlurey.Stage` and residual
  levels through a four-position carrier, embeds `TriTruth` into
  `exact`/`partial`/`noTypedMeet` while excluding `contradiction` from the tone
  image, and `DASHI.Algebra.SixfoldLogic` maps a six-position carrier onto
  `Base369.HexTruth`. `DASHI.Everything` imports the bridge modules.
- add and aggregate-import the NGram / ITIR sidecar surfaces.
  `DASHI.Combinatorics.NGram` now names fixed-width ternary windows plus
  bigram/trigram aliases and adjacent agreement observables.
  `DASHI.Interop.ITIRJoinBridge` now maps UFTC severity/code joins into
  `DASHI.Pressure`, proves join preservation, and keeps monotonicity as named
  proof-gap types. `DASHI.Everything` imports both.
- fix an aggregate import blocker in `LilaTraceFamily`.
  The module now imports `ExecutionContractLaws` qualified-only, avoiding an
  overloaded `receipt` projection and allowing `DASHI.Everything` to typecheck.
- correct docs/UML current-state sidecar wording.
  `README.md`, `CoreSpineBridge.md`, `OriginTraceabilityLedger.md`,
  `RepoMetasystem.puml`, `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, and
  `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now distinguish landed/imported CoreSpine and
  ultrametric bridge state from active next wiring. The diagrams no longer
  describe Brain dynamic transport, Brain-DNA whole-chain integration, the
  physics-facing brain handoff, or the p2 offline L2 obstruction certificate as
  still absent. They also record that `NGram` and `ITIRJoinBridge` exist as
  non-claiming adapter sidecars and are now aggregate-imported by
  `DASHI.Everything`.
- add the origin-traceability reconciliation surface.
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now records the safe reading of the
  downloaded disconnection diagnosis: the origin thesis is a bridge/governance
  spine, `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` exists locally but remains bounded,
  the empirical lane exists but lacks an adequacy theorem, and
  `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem` still needs a convergence-rate promotion.
  `README.md`, `architecture.md`, `PhysicsGuide`, `UnificationClaim`,
  `PhysicsRecoveryLedger`, `NaturalDynamicsLaw`, and `RepoMetasystem.puml` now
  route to that ledger.
- make the main diagrams more communicative about true repo state.
  `RepoMetasystem.puml`, `CanonicalProofSpine.puml`,
  `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now include
  status boards that separate theorem-owned, bridge-only, packaging,
  empirical, and open-gate surfaces, including explicit notes for chi2 carrier
  mismatch, B4 `standaloneOnly`, convergence-rate dynamics, empirical
  adequacy, and atom/chemistry relaxation gates.
- render documentation diagrams to SVG and PNG.
  `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh` now emits both formats for top-level
  `Docs/*.puml` files, and the generated PNG previews are present beside the
  existing SVG previews.
- add antifascistic boundary and music governance.
  `Docs/AntifascisticBoundaryAndMusic.md` now records the safe reading of
  invertible entropy-preserving systems, the three-body carrier-vs-observable
  split, and the music MDL basin toy.
  `Docs/MusicalSymmetryMDL.md` now records the safe pitch-class bridge
  `Z/12Z ~= Z/3Z x Z/4Z` and rejects the false perfect-fifth `Z3` shortcut.
  `RepoMetasystem.puml` and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now show this lane as
  exploratory examples/toys rather than theorem closure.
- add the named musical attractor target.
  `Docs/MusicalAttractorTheorem.md` records the precise exploratory bridge:
  `(Z/12Z)^n` carrier, chromatic sum metric, nearest-scale `K_music`,
  `L_music` Lyapunov/MDL analog, one-step descent to `S^n`, attractor classes,
  CRT and tonal-cluster quotient separation, and explicit non-claim boundaries.
  `RepoMetasystem.puml`, `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`, and
  `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml` now expose the target as an exploratory music
  surface rather than a theorem-owned physics lane.
- record the core-spine bridge-module request.
  The next implementation adds explicit `Trit`/`TriTruth`,
  CRT/J moonshine, ternary carrier, agreement-ultrametric contraction,
  stage-quotient, and p47/p59/p71 active-wall bridge modules, while preserving
  the distinction between proved bridges and still-open descent obligations.
- land the six core-spine bridge modules and import them from
  `DASHI.Everything`.
  The new surfaces prove the `Trit`/`TriTruth` isomorphism, scalar moonshine
  bridge, carrier-vector lift, `Stage` quotient seam, p47/p59/p71 active-wall
  positions, and the agreement-ultrametric strict-contraction-to-certificate
  path without claiming an abstract fascistic descent proof.
  Targeted Agda checks pass for the six new modules; the aggregate
  `DASHI.Everything` check remains longer than the 60s bounded validation
  window and timed out in existing closure imports.
- update docs and diagrams for the core-spine bridge.
  Added `Docs/CoreSpineBridge.md`, updated the physics guide, algebraic carrier
  summary, moonshine proof checklist, and validation-target list, then added a
  distinct CoreSpine bridge layer to `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml` and
  `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`.
  SVG previews were regenerated with `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh`.
- tighten the reviewer-facing core-spine formalisms.
  `TritTriTruthBridge` now includes transported `tritXor`
  identity/associativity and an explicit non-homomorphism witness for
  `Trit.inv`; `TritCarrierBridge` now proves cyclic rotation isometry for the
  prefix ultrametric and exposes reflection isometry; `CRTPeriodJFixedBridge`
  now defines `W3` and names the still-open active-wall periodicity and
  Monster-representation obligations.
  Added `Docs/CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md` to separate supported theorem
  claims from the invalid stage-kernel/exact-sequence language and the unproved
  `W3` periodicity claim.
- record the algebra/logic/modular/contraction theorem-island bridge lane.
  The implementation target is explicit bridge or obstruction surfaces for
  `Base369`, `LogicTlurey`, `CRTPeriod`, `JFixedPoint`,
  `FascisticSystem`, and `Contraction`; the repo already has
  `Ultrametric.agda`, so the remaining gap is integration, not a missing file.
- land those bridge surfaces:
  `TriTruthScanOrderBridge` exposes the two-state `ScanOrder` equivariance
  obstruction and a refined three-state carrier,
  `LogicTlureyQuotientBridge` makes the seed/overflow quotient collapse
  explicit,
  `CRTJFixedPointBridge` connects `period + 1` to the moonshine contraction,
  and `FascisticContractionBridge` derives attractors only from explicit
  stabilization or strict-contraction witnesses while recording the remaining
  descent gap.
  `DASHI.Everything` now imports the bridge modules.
- record the theorem-island correction for the Brain/DNA/Chemistry lane.
  The next pass targets derived recovery boundaries, non-trivial checksum
  algebra, semantic equivariance, cross-band Hamiltonian distinction,
  brain/computer crossover, and a bounded antifascist/logic bridge rather than
  more theorem-thin wrapper records.
- add the first break-open surfaces for those theorem islands:
  a derived base-code recovery boundary plus default-code obstruction,
  non-trivial checksum algebra, Brain-DNA semantic equivariance, a sheet
  Hamiltonian distinguishing witness, a first brain/computer crossover, and a
  bounded LogicTlurey / antifascist bridge into the computer carrier.
- record the blocker-formula worker routing for the MDL/continuum,
  natural-charge/`p2`, and atomic-chemistry lanes.
  The abstract/canonical seam and GR/QFT consumer upgrade are explicitly
  dependency-parked until the MDL seam witness and adapter seam discharge land.
- record the Brain/DNA/Chemistry crossover routing.
  Brain dynamic transport and Brain-DNA whole-chain integration/realism are
  the next independent lanes; chemistry cross-band invariant work remains on
  the existing chemistry worker; the physics-facing brain-to-chemistry handoff
  is parked until the whole-chain integration law promotes.
- land the P1/P2 blocker-discharge surfaces through workers:
  the MDL/continuum lane now rejects the old global obligation and exposes the
  CR-retarget correction surface, while the natural-charge/`p2` lane now has a
  theorem-thin offline L2 obstruction certificate instead of a constructive
  `β_p2` bridge.
- land the first Brain/DNA/Chemistry crossover promotion surfaces through
  workers:
  brain dynamic semantic transport, Brain-DNA whole-chain integration with
  checksum compositionality and a realism floor, and the local chemistry
  cross-band invariant law.
  The physics-facing handoff is now the remaining bounded composition target.
- promote the brain-to-chemistry physics handoff as a bounded wrapper:
  `BrainPhysicsHandoffPromotion` composes `H_phys` through `I_chain`, carries
  the Candidate256 `Lchem` cross-band law, and exposes the existing
  `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` gate surfaces without widening to spectra,
  scale-setting, bonding, wet-lab realism, or full atom recovery.

## 2026-04-17

- inhabit the observable/signature pressure gate for the current physics
  closure round.  Added a canonical `promotionReady` instance, finite
  arithmetic distortion budget, alternative-carrier control cases, minimal
  observable gauge-entry fiber/action laws, and a receipt bridge carrying
  distortion plus observable/signature/promotion statuses.  Also added the
  PlantUML sketch in `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.puml`.
- extend the arithmetic distortion budget with
  `pairWeightedTransportedDistortion`, the first nontrivial computable
  DeltaPair comparison between scalar cancellation pressure and weighted pair
  energy.  The bound uses an exact finite epsilon and avoids asserting
  Delta/Q equality.
- strengthen `pairWeightedTransportedDistortion` so its public epsilon is now
  the structural `weightedSupport + scalarPressure` budget, proved via
  `weightedPressure≤weightedSupport`; the exact absolute difference remains
  available as `pairExactEpsilon`.
- tighten `pairWeightedTransportedDistortion` again by replacing the scalar
  self-budget with tracked support.  The public epsilon is now
  `weightedSupport + trackedSupport`, using
  `weightedPressure≤weightedSupport` for the weighted side and
  `totalPressure≤trackedSupport` for the scalar side.
- thread that decomposed pair support budget into the observable/signature
  receipt lane.  `PairSupportDistortionBudget` now exposes the weighted leg,
  tracked-support leg, epsilon decomposition, and combined bound, and
  `receiptFromObservableSignatureWithPairSupport` packages it beside the
  promotion/status receipt.
- add the first concrete observable/signature receipt instance.
  `CanonicalObservableSignatureReceiptInstance` builds a minimal identity-step
  execution contract for the canonical shift state and uses it to inhabit a
  pair-support observable/signature receipt for the canonical promoted point,
  without claiming recovered dynamics or gauge/matter closure.
- add a live shift-step observable/signature receipt instance.
  `ShiftObservableSignatureReceiptInstance` adapts the existing
  `shiftContract {1}{3}` admissibility witness into the newer closure receipt
  shape, then packages the anchored
  `trajectoryGen i0 -> trajectoryGen i1`
  step with the promoted observable/signature point and decomposed pair-support
  budget.
- add a non-singleton shift-backed observable/signature pressure-test instance.
  `ShiftObservableSignaturePressureTestInstance` places the forced
  observable/signature gate over the live shift carrier and exposes the
  anchored trajectory endpoints as promotion-ready pressure points; the live
  shift receipt now uses that shift-backed promotion witness rather than the
  singleton canonical pressure point.
- refine the shift-backed pressure status so the shift carrier is no longer
  described as wholly promotion-ready.
  The status surface now discriminates promotion-ready anchored endpoints from
  held/control states while keeping the observable/signature gate wording
  theorem-thin.
- add a report-only held/control pressure surface beside the promoted receipt
  lane.  `ReceiptFromObservableSignature` now exposes
  `ObservableSignaturePressureReport`, and
  `ShiftObservableSignatureReceiptInstance` instantiates it for the
  held/control shift exit point without changing the execution receipt
  contract.
- sharpen the alternative-carrier control lane with explicit typed reports.
  `AlternativeCarrierCases` now exposes forced / held / failed case reports
  rather than leaving those statuses implied by the case labels alone.
- strengthen `ObservableGaugeEntry` so the abstract entry contract now carries
  an explicit per-state `gaugeFiber` witness in addition to observable and
  admissibility preservation.
- tighten the arithmetic Δ→Q control surface by adding
  `zeroErrorDominanceTransport` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaQuadraticDistortion.agda`, giving a concrete
  constructor from distortion data to a bounded `DominanceTransport` witness
  with explicit finite error legs.
- tighten the canonical quadratic bottleneck by extending
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.UniqueUpToScaleSeam` with explicit
  scale-aware data (`scaleFactor`, `normalizeToScaledQ̂core`) and by exposing
  scale-aware admissibility and agreement witnesses while preserving the
  existing normalized consumer surface.
- tighten that same bottleneck again by replacing the raw `⊤` placeholder
  slots for nondegeneracy and isotropy compatibility with named
  `NondegeneracySeam` and `IsotropyCompatibilitySeam` records on
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` and `AdmissibleFor`, while keeping the
  old compatibility fields available for downstream consumers that still read
  them directly.
- strengthen those new seam records into theorem-bearing inhabitants on the
  canonical lane: `NondegeneracySeam` now records canonical origin
  normalization, `IsotropyCompatibilitySeam` now records compatibility of the
  dynamics step with `Q̂core`, and the scale path now has a
  scale-parameterized constructor plus one genuine non-unit admissible
  double-scale witness on the canonical `m = 0` lane.
- strengthen the canonical quadratic bottleneck again: `NondegeneracySeam`
  now carries full normalization to `Q̂core` and exposes a conditional strong
  nondegeneracy upgrade through `CoreAnisotropyAssumption`;
  `IsotropyCompatibilitySeam` now carries explicit shell-respecting isotropy
  structure plus a named residual action-level gap; and the non-unit scale
  witness is generalized from one hard-coded object to any strong witness with
  `dimension ≡ 0`.
- tighten those remaining canonical quadratic gaps again:
  `CoreScaleSeam` now exposes the positive-dimension non-unit scaling boundary
  explicitly and threads it into scale-aware admissibility constructors without
  pretending a positive-dimensional witness already exists;
  `CoreAnisotropyAssumption` is now reduced through the definitional bridge
  `Q̂core≡sumSq`, so the remaining anisotropy gap is stated as an explicit
  `HFZ.sumSq` zero-only-at-origin premise; and `ResidualIsotropyGap` now
  carries an action application surface plus a shell-to-action transport lift,
  so the remaining isotropy gap is unconditional inhabited transport rather
  than the older shell-only boundary.
- tighten the same seams again:
  positive-dimensional full-core `CoreScaleSeam` now has an explicit
  obstruction theorem (`positiveDimensionCoreScaleSeamForcesUnit`), and the
  remaining non-unit story is pushed onto an explicit restricted carrier
  interface (`CoreScaleCarrierSeam`); `CoreAnisotropyAssumption` is narrowed
  further to `SquareZeroResidualPremise` plus
  `SumSqZeroDecompositionPremise`, from which the older
  `CoreAnisotropyResidualPremise` is derived; and isotropy now packages a real
  inhabited action transport object (`InhabitedIsotropyTransport`) whenever a
  shell transport boundary witness is available.
- tighten the bottleneck boundary again:
  `AdmissibleFor` remains a whole-carrier surface, with
  `admissibleForCoreScaleSeam` and
  `admissibleForPositiveDimensionScaleFactorUnit` making explicit that any
  positive-dimensional admissible whole-carrier witness already forces unit
  scale; the local anisotropy kernel is now discharged through
  `squareZeroResidualTheorem` and `sumSqZeroDecompositionTheorem`, yielding
  `dischargedCoreAnisotropyAssumption` and the default strong theorem path
  `strongNondegeneracy`; and the downstream
  signature/Clifford/gauge boundary is now stated explicitly as
  normalized-quadratic-only, so unconditional shell-orbit existence is not
  part of the current consumer contract.
- extend that same explicit downstream boundary to the spin/Dirac layer via
  `spinDiracBridgeBoundary`, so the Stage-C path now states directly that it
  factors through the existing normalized-quadratic-only signature contract
  rather than implicitly relying on stronger closure facts.
- extend the same boundary one layer higher into the canonical closure stack:
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness` now exposes `closureQuadraticBoundary`, and
  `PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage` records that normalized-quadratic
  boundary explicitly beside the stored bridge witnesses. This makes the
  full-closure side honest about carrying bridge packages rather than
  consuming nondegeneracy.
- add the explicit Layer-2 separator search artifacts:
  `Ontology.Hecke.ProfileSummaryFamilySeparation` now states the honest choice
  between a separating pair and full collapse under `profileSummaryFamily`,
  `Ontology.Hecke.CurrentSaturatedProfileSummaryFamilySeparation` adds the
  saturated-branch specialization, and `scripts/profile_summary_separation.py`
  is the Python mirror over the current generator taxonomy. Replace the pure
  stub adapter with a precomputed-artifact-first
  `scripts/profile_summary_adapter.py`, add the schema example
  `artifacts/hecke/profile_summary_family.example.json`, and record that the
  remaining gap is missing materialized data rather than missing Python shape.
  Add `Docs/ClosureContractStatus.md` to record that the present downstream
  closure chain is normalized-quadratic-only.
- close that remaining materialization gap:
  `scripts/materialize_profile_summary_family.hs` now emits
  `artifacts/hecke/profile_summary_family.json` directly from the compiled
  MAlonzo bridge, and the resulting search shows that the full
  `profileSummaryFamily` invariant already separates both the full current
  nine-generator taxonomy and the saturated-only slice.
- add `scripts/minimize_profile_summary_projection.py` and record the first
  minimization result: on the current materialized artifact, each of
  `forcedStableCount`, `totalDrift`, and `contractiveCount` preserves the same
  partition as the full six-field family on both scopes. Promote
  `contractiveCount` into theorem-facing Agda surfaces via
  `Ontology.Hecke.ContractiveCountLayer2Invariant` and
  `Ontology.Hecke.CurrentSaturatedContractiveCountLayer2Invariant`, keeping
  the current claim honest: this is a current-domain Layer-2 singleton
  surface, not yet an extension-robust global minimality theorem.
  `forcedStableCount`, `totalDrift`, and `contractiveCount` alone preserves the
  same partition as the full six-field family on both the full taxonomy and
  the saturated-only slice.
- tighten `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` by replacing the old
  `factorUniqueSeam` placeholder with an explicit generator-image uniqueness
  theorem on the universal factorization surface.
- add the canonical normalized empirical-artifact boundary for legacy
  `dashitest` HEPData outputs.
  `scripts/hepdata_artifact_schema.json` now defines the repo-native JSON
  contract, and `scripts/hepdata_adapter.py` now normalizes the old
  measurement / metrics / timeseries / certification files into that
  contract with explicit completeness and non-claim status summaries,
  without rerunning fits or fetching HEPData.
  The adapter now also prefers NPZ-backed `x/y/cov` measurement surfaces over
  covariance-free lens tables when both exist, and records per-field
  readiness for `x`, `y`, and `cov`.
- add the first thin consumer for canonical legacy HEPData artifacts.
  `scripts/hepdata_consumer.py` now loads one normalized artifact,
  selects one family payload,
  requires `empirical-artifact-ready` validation plus `x/y/cov` field
  readiness,
  and terminates at the measurement-surface carrier in
  `scripts/prototype_schema.py`
  without invoking runner, scorecard, fitting, or theorem-side logic.
- replace stem-coincidence family resolution in the legacy HEPData adapter
  with an explicit crosswalk.
  `scripts/hepdata_family_crosswalk.json`
  now records canonical family-to-measurement/metrics/timeseries/
  certification mappings, and
  `scripts/hepdata_adapter.py`
  now records family-resolution metadata in each payload instead of relying
  on stem-only inference when source families drift across stages.
- add a report-only health lane for validated HEPData measurement surfaces.
  `scripts/hepdata_surface_report.py`
  now consumes one canonical artifact and emits covariance/shape/range
  diagnostics for the extracted `MeasurementSurface` without constructing a
  `DashiStateSchema` or a `Δ` interpretation.
  The report now also exposes
  `projection_eligible`
  separately from shape-only admission and flags degraded metric carriers
  explicitly.
- add a narrow regression fixture for the HEPData family boundary.
  `tests/test_hepdata_bridge.py`
  plus
  `tests/fixtures/hepdata_family_crosswalk_fixture.json`
  now pin the canonical family mapping and the non-alias rule keeping
  `ptll_76_106_table` distinct from `pTll_76_106`.
- add the first projection-contract stub without widening the empirical
  bridge.
  `scripts/hepdata_projection_contract.py`
  and
  `Docs/MeasurementSurfaceProjectionContract.md`
  now define contract-only projection result/status surfaces and hard
  preconditions for any future
  `MeasurementSurface -> DashiStateSchema`
  lane, with no projection implementation and no theorem promotion.
- tighten that projection contract with a declared transform vocabulary.
  The contract/doc lane now pins
  `raw`,
  `gradient`,
  `whitened`,
  and
  `other-declared`
  as first-class transform names with explicit preconditions, metric-geometry
  preservation flags, regularization requirements, and downstream-use
  declarations, while still leaving projection itself unimplemented.
- add a vocabulary-enforcement helper for the transform lane.
  `scripts/hepdata_transform_validator.py`
  now validates exact transform-name membership against
  `TRANSFORM_VOCAB`
  with no alias fallback, and
  `tests/test_hepdata_transform_validator.py`
  now pins the closed vocabulary plus the canonical `raw` transform spec,
  including its comparability group.
- add a sibling-repo support note for `../dashitest` to the top-level
  `README`.
  The note now points at the strongest diagnostic and measurement-side
  surfaces there while keeping the boundary explicit that `dashitest` is a
  support repo, not a code dependency or theorem witness for this tree.
- surface the photonuclear empirical lane in the top-level `README`.
  The empirical-first owner stack is now visible from the repo entrypoint via
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalConstantsRegistry.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalMeasurementSurface.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalEvidenceSummary.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalValidationSummary.agda`, with
  `Docs/PhotonuclearEmpiricalRegistry.md` as the canonical map.
- add the photonuclear empirical validation summary surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalValidationSummary.agda`
  now wraps the empirical evidence summary in the thinnest repo-facing
  validation owner, with explicit status tags and counts but no physics
  claim.
- add the missing repo-facing owner for the current photonuclear empirical
  lane.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalEvidenceSummary.agda`
  now combines the constants registry and measurement surface into one
  empirical-only control surface with explicit counts and status tags, and
  `Docs/PhotonuclearEmpiricalRegistry.md`
  now records the canonical ownership map tying the Agda sidecars to the
  active script and documentation surfaces.
- refresh the newer Dashi ChatGPT URL
  `69e0cb8f-9984-8399-a5fe-d9dbffca71e3`
  again and record the corrected canonical resolution in repo context.
  The current canonical DB match for that online UUID is now
  `Dashi on Quantum Computing`
  with canonical thread ID
  `934b67438a1d7732f48b2690a3ea215077cc47c3`.
  The refreshed turns sharpen the repo-facing plan:
  keep the cancellation bridge honest,
  formalize the Goldbach lane as theorem-thin analysis objects
  (`EnergyΔ`, `GoldbachCone`, `GoldbachAmplitude`, theorem ladder),
  and keep the zeta/Riemann lane explicitly analysis-side and non-claiming.
- land the first theorem-thin Goldbach formal-object module under
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda`.
  The new analysis-side pack introduces:
  `EnergyΔ`,
  `GoldbachCone`,
  `GoldbachAmplitude`,
  `GoldbachTheoremLadder`,
  and
  `GoldbachProgramPack`,
  with explicit analysis-only / no-solved-Goldbach / no-solved-RH
  boundaries.
- tighten the Goldbach analysis lane with a concrete weighted-valuation
  anchor. `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now exports
  `weightedValuationEnergyΔ` and the canonical
  `goldbachWeightedValuationEnergyΔ` instance wired directly to
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/WeightedValuationEnergy.agda`, while still making no
  Goldbach or `Δ -> Q̂core` claim.
- add the first bounded/sample existence constructor to the Goldbach
  analysis lane.
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now exports
  `GoldbachExistenceWitness`,
  `BoundedGoldbachExistence`,
  and
  `sampleExistenceFromConeWitness`,
  so one admissible prime-pair witness can now be carried constructively
  inside the theorem-thin program surface without claiming a proof of
  universal strong Goldbach.
- instantiate the Goldbach analysis lane with one concrete sample witness.
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now adds
  `sampleGoldbachCone`,
  `sampleGoldbachExistenceWitness`,
  and
  `sampleGoldbachBoundedExistence`
  for the explicit `2 + 2 = 4` sample on the weighted-valuation energy
  surface.
- extend the Goldbach analysis lane with a second nontrivial sample witness.
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now also adds
  `sampleGoldbachCone8`,
  `sampleGoldbachExistenceWitness8`,
  and
  `sampleGoldbachBoundedExistence8`
  for the explicit `3 + 5 = 8` sample.
- tighten the Goldbach theorem ladder so existence is no longer a bare
  theorem-thin `Set`.
  `GoldbachTheoremLadder.existenceSurface` now requires a
  `BoundedGoldbachExistence`
  witness on the corresponding cone, matching the fact that the analysis lane
  now carries concrete sample-side witnesses.
- extend the zeta analysis lane with one concrete derived observation over
  the current Abel-summed sample surface.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda` now exports
  `ZetaBoundaryContrastView` and
  `mkBoundaryContrastView`,
  which compute the exact sample-to-sample eta and zeta boundary deltas from
  `AbelZetaSamplingSurface` while still making no RH, zero-finder, or
  critical-line interpolation claim.
- extend the zeta analysis lane with a second concrete derived observation.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda` now also exports
  `ZetaEtaTransferView` and
  `mkEtaTransferView`,
  which compute the exact eta-to-zeta transfer gaps at the current sampled
  indices while still making no RH, zero-finder, or Euler-product claim.
- add the first constructive witness object for the current three-body
  branching lane under
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/BoundaryGeneratedBranchingWitness.agda`.
  The new record packages one boundary state, one generated branch member,
  one regime label, one basin-anchored branch state, and one observed regime
  weight into a typed witness sourced from the existing
  `PredictabilityTheorem`,
  `Interference`,
  and
  `BundleIntensity`
  surfaces, without claiming a solved chaos theorem.
- tighten that three-body branching witness so the chosen branch member is
  explicitly identified with the theorem-generated boundary branch.
  `BoundaryGeneratedBranchingWitness.agda` now carries the field
  `branchMemberMatchesGeneratedBoundary`
  instead of leaving the witness object and theorem-generated branch only
  side-by-side.
- refresh the newer Dashi ChatGPT URL
  `69e0cb8f-9984-8399-a5fe-d9dbffca71e3`
  into the canonical archive and record the updated resolution metadata in
  repo context.
  The canonical DB thread still resolves as
  `Coprime Primes and DeltaInteraction`
  with canonical thread ID
  `e4a817086446a12712a5a150254f6ae79f8c566b`;
  the later turns sharpen that the current cancellation-energy bridge
  remains an explicit witness-gated lane through
  `TransportPreservesCancellationPressure theorem dim≡15`,
  while the intended next closure candidate is a separate weighted valuation
  measurement layer
  `Φ(x) = (v_p(x) * sqrt(log p))_p`
  and
  `Q₊(x) = Σ_p v_p(x)^2 log p`
  feeding the existing contraction-derived quadratic/signature stack.
- sync the top-level Stage C notes and TODO frontier to that refreshed
  reading.
  The repo docs now distinguish the current concrete cancellation-pressure
  transport seam from the proposed weighted valuation lane, instead of
  implying that the current tracked-profile transport already proves the
  full `Δ -> Q̂core` bridge.
- land the first constructive weighted valuation helper lane in code.
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/WeightedValuationEnergy.agda` now packages tracked-prime
  valuation vectors, weighted valuation energies, weighted quadratic energies,
  and `Vec ℤ 15` transport helpers for the future `Φ/Q₊` bridge.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda` now consumes that
  lane as a separate `WeightedValuationMeasurementCandidate` surface without
  pretending it already proves the canonical quadratic bridge.
- tighten the weighted-valuation forward lane into a record-level witness
  surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda` now adds
  `canonicalValuationTransport`,
  `WeightedValuationTransportCompatibility`,
  and
  `WeightedValuationForwardCandidate`
  so the weighted lane can carry transport coherence, candidate-level
  admissibility, and weighted-quadratic agreement without claiming an
  identification with `Q̂core`.
- tighten the cancellation-pressure seam to match the audited code reality.
  The bridge module now exposes the honest profile-side equality
  `pairCancellationEnergyMatchesEmbeddedProfileScore`, while the stronger
  cancellation-to-canonical-quadratic identification remains explicit as an
  external assumption surface because the current tracked-profile transport
  lifts lane values directly but `Q̂core` evaluates `Σ lane²`.
- replace the bare cancellation-pressure theorem alias with a record-level
  compatibility surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`
  and
  `canonicalCancellationPressureCompatibility`
  so the cancellation lane records:
  pressure bridge,
  arithmetic energy,
  transport,
  and the external `pressurePreserved` witness explicitly,
  while keeping any `Δ -> Q̂core` identification out of scope.
- give the weaker profile-side seam its own arithmetic owner.
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/ArithmeticPrimeProfileBridge.agda`
  now exposes
  `EmbeddedPrimeProfileMeasurement`,
  and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `EmbeddedProfileScoreCompatibility`
  plus
  `canonicalEmbeddedProfileScoreCompatibility`,
  making the honest
  `deltaSum -> embeddedProfileScore`
  lane explicit without pretending it is already the theorem-side quadratic.
- add the next thin signature/Clifford packaging adapter on top of the
  existing closure stack.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `DeltaQuadraticSignatureCliffordPackage`
  and
  `deltaBridgeToSignatureCliffordPackage`,
  letting an existing delta bridge carry its normalized quadratic,
  inherited signature-31 data,
  and a specialized Clifford presentation handle
  without introducing a new derivation or widening the cancellation claim.
- add a theorem-thin three-body boundary-of-contraction scaffold under
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/`.
  The new namespace packages:
  `State`,
  `Step`,
  `Regime`,
  `Energy`,
  `Wave`,
  and `Bridge`
  as the repo-native surface for treating the three-body problem as a
  non-globally-contracting system with cone-boundary dynamics.
  The scaffold explicitly stops at state/operator packaging, local
  energy/action, regime classification, and a wave-facing admissible-path
  kernel; it does not claim a closed-form solver or a completed chaos theorem.
- extend that three-body scaffold with an explicit prediction layer.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictiveBoundary.agda` now adds
  `Delta3Body`,
  `EnergyΔ3`,
  `Action3`,
  `LocalPredictiveHorizon`,
  `ChaosBoundary`,
  and `ThreeBodyPredictiveBoundaryLayer`.
  This makes the repo-native claim precise:
  better observations improve local state/regime estimates, while
  non-contracting regions still bound long-horizon forecast reliability.
- extend the same three-body namespace with an interference/path-family layer.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/Interference.agda` now adds theorem-thin surfaces
  for path families, regime amplitudes, regime weights, regime distributions,
  and boundary-generated branching.
  This lets the repo state the next stronger claim cleanly:
  chaotic three-body evolution is modeled not as total loss of structure, but
  as an action-weighted interference pattern over admissible future regimes.
- anchor the new three-body predictive surface to one existing repo-native
  status witness rather than leaving it purely nominal.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictiveBoundary.agda` now imports
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Basin` and ties
  `LocalPredictiveHorizon`
  to a concrete
  `Basin State`
  through
  `basinSurface`
  and
  `basinForecastCompatibility`.
  This keeps the local-horizon story precise:
  the current forecast surface is now explicitly basin-relative and
  eventual-stability-facing, without pretending the repo already proves a
  stronger global chaos or Lyapunov theorem for three-body dynamics.
- anchor the theorem-thin three-body bridge to that same basin-facing
  admissibility surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/Bridge.agda`
  now carries
  `basinPredictionSurface`
  plus
  `basinPredictionCompatible`,
  keeping the bridge aligned with
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictiveBoundary.agda`
  instead of introducing a second bridge-local admissibility notion.
- expose that basin-anchored three-body bridge at the theorem-surface
  entrypoint and make the bridge carry the predictive-horizon projection
  explicitly.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/Bridge.agda`
  now also carries
  `predictiveHorizonSurface`
  plus
  `predictiveHorizonCompatible`,
  and
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/TheoremSurface.agda`
  now publicly re-exports the bridge alongside the theorem-thin predictability
  surfaces.
- add a repo-native theorem-surface layer for the three-body lane instead of
  leaving the simulation/theorem connection only in chat prose.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictabilityTheorem.agda`
  now packages theorem-thin surfaces for:
  cone preservation,
  local strict contraction,
  local Lyapunov descent,
  basin-relative predictive horizon,
  boundary counterexample,
  interior coherence,
  boundary branching,
  and regime-weight convergence.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/TheoremSurface.agda`
  is the thin public entrypoint for that lane.
- add an analysis-side zeta visualization scaffold aligned with the new
  three-body bundle/intensity reading.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda`
  now carries:
  `CriticalLineMagnitude`,
  `PhaseFlow`,
  `ZeroSpacing`,
  `ProjectedZetaFeatureView`,
  and
  `ZetaVisualizationPack`.
  This lives under `Analysis`, not `Physics`, and is explicitly
  visualization-only:
  no RH proof, zero-finding engine, or spectral-closure theorem is claimed.
- tighten the new three-body theorem surface by replacing one remaining raw
  placeholder with a concrete boundary-branching witness.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictabilityTheorem.agda`
  now defines
  `BoundaryBranchingCompatibility State Energy Phase`
  to pin theorem-level boundary branching to the existing
  `BoundaryGeneratedBranching`
  surfaces already exported by the interference and bundle/intensity layers.
  The same theorem surface now uses the existing
  `ThreeBodyRegimeDistribution`
  record directly for regime-weight convergence instead of another dependent
  `Set` placeholder.
- ground the zeta visualization lane on exact repo values rather than only a
  type shell.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda`
  now carries
  `AbelZetaSamplingSurface`
  with explicit equality witnesses tying the visualization anchor values
  back to
  `eta0`,
  `etaMinus1`,
  `zeta0`,
  and
  `zetaMinus1`
  from
  `DASHI/Analysis/AbelZeta.agda`.
- add stable README-facing image copies for the current three-body and zeta
  visualization lanes under
  `Docs/Images/three-body/`
  and
  `Docs/Images/zeta/`,
  and document them in `README.md` with:
  provenance,
  formalism sources,
  intended reading,
  and explicit non-claim boundaries.

## 2026-04-17

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalConstantsRegistry.agda`
  as the repo-native photonuclear/LHC empirical constants registry.
  The new surface records the reduced surrogate defaults and example-derived
  values with explicit provenance strings and claim-boundary tags, so the
  empirical side stays clearly separated from physics claims or fits.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalMeasurementSurface.agda`
  and align the photonuclear docs with it.
  The LHC lane now has an explicit measurement-side packaging surface for
  measured observables, per-sample payloads, and in-scope/out-of-scope claim
  bookkeeping, and the bridge/capstone notes now point to both that surface
  and the constants registry as provenance sidecars rather than proof-bearing
  physics modules.

## 2026-04-15

- add the missing `AdmissibleFor` abstraction to
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`, along with
  `admissibleForFromStrong` and `admissibleForNormalization`, so the strong
  quadratic witness can be packaged under the admissible surface the thread
  described.
- thread that admissible quadratic packaging into
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.agda` by carrying
  `dynamicsMap` and `admissibleQuadratic` on the theorem surface, and update
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  to read normalization through the theorem-level admissible package.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda` as the first
  compile-thin `Δ -> quadratic` bridge surface.
  The new module does not introduce a second normalization path; it packages
  a Delta-side quadratic candidate as a theorem-level admissible object and
  reuses `canonicalOutputAgreement` plus `AdmissibleFor.uniqueUpToScale` to
  compare it pointwise with the canonical contraction-derived quadratic.
- extend that same module with an explicit `DeltaQuadraticCandidate` layer and
  the first concrete integer-pair arithmetic stub.
  The new candidate surface separates:
  integer-pair pressure bridge,
  arithmetic energy in `ℤ`,
  state transport into the quadratic carrier,
  transported energy/quadratic coherence,
  and admissibility.
  The first stub uses cancellation energy on
  `DeltaPair = Int × Int`, adds inherited signature projections on both
  Delta-side records, and implements the tracked-carrier transport
  concretely from the arithmetic prime-profile vector under the explicit
  theorem-side witness `dimension ≡ 15`.
  The remaining cancellation-to-quadratic identification is now exposed as
  the explicit constructor input
  `TransportPreservesCancellationPressure theorem dim≡15`,
  so the file no longer hides that gap behind a module-level postulate.
- sync the repo-facing arithmetic notes with the currently landed tracked
  pressure / interaction implementation.
  The tracked carrier now lives canonically in `DASHI/TrackedPrimes.agda`,
  base coprime evidence is centralized in
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/TrackedCoprimeTable.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Arithmetic/CoprimeLayer.agda` now discharges the smallest
  honest tracked seam:
  `distinctTrackedPrimePowersCoprime`.
- record the currently landed interaction and packaging surfaces in the repo
  notes:
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/DeltaInteraction.agda` now carries the one-lane and
  two-lane budget surfaces,
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/EpsilonBound.agda` exports the explicit tracked constant
  `trackedPrimeLogConstant = logNat 71` plus
  `explicitTrackedEpsilonBound`,
  and `DASHI/Arithmetic/PartialResult.agda` re-exports the combined theorem
  bundle.
- extend the recorded diagnostics status for
  `scripts/check_prime_profile_counterexample_search.py`:
  threshold counts, pair-threshold summaries, threshold signatures, and
  shared-budget decay/grouping are now part of the canonical report shape,
  with no flagged counterexample on the current canonical sample states.
- run `robust-context-fetch` for the requested ChatGPT URLs and record the
  result in repo context.
  The JMD thread
  `69c4a9b1-d014-83a0-8bb0-873e4eaa4098`
  resolves from the canonical archive DB as
  `JMD FORMAL EXPLAIN - Meme System Explanation`
  with canonical thread ID
  `c6e383233d0d7c4efde671be1432c825054cb222`.
  The Dashi thread
  `69de4fb3-c3e4-839e-aea4-08b086794879`
  now also resolves from the canonical archive DB as
  `Coprime Primes and DeltaInteraction`
  with canonical thread ID
  `e4a817086446a12712a5a150254f6ae79f8c566b`
  after a clean serial refresh inserted `83` messages and merged `6`
  duplicates.

## 2026-04-06

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaDashiBridge.agda` as the first repo-native
  LILA-to-DASHI bridge stub.
  The module packages the existing execution contract together with the
  canonical receipt-layer phase split, so the repo now has a named seam for
  reading LILA as the execution system and DASHI as the admissibility lens.
  Sync `Docs/LILA_DASHI_Bridge.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`
  so the bridge reading is recorded once in prose and once in code.
- add `scripts/delta_cone_lila.py`, `scripts/checkpoint_prime_vectors.py`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaTraceFamily.agda` to turn the bridge into a
  runnable analyzer plus a minimal trace-family lift.
  The scripts operationalize the delta-cone test and the prime-exponent
  checkpoint encoding; the Agda module gives the first trace-row schema that
  can be lifted back into the execution-contract seam.
- add `scripts/run_compare.sh` and `scripts/plot_training_dynamics.py` to
  match the thread's latest recommendation for a minimal credibility package:
  baseline-vs-LILA comparison plus simple training-dynamics plots.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BadModeSuppression.agda` and thread that receipt-side surface through `LilaDashiBridge.agda` so the empirical bad-mode suppression metrics now have a named formal stub: measured bad mass, a coherence gate, and a non-increasing-after-coherence target.
- tighten the bridge UX with `scripts/run_all.sh`, parameterized model
  entrypoints in `scripts/run_compare.sh`, and a short repo-facing usage page
  plus PlantUML flow diagram in `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.md` and
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml`, with the rendered preview in
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`.

## 2026-04-05

- add `scripts/run_agda_easy_to_hard.py` as the simple front-door runner for
  the current validated Agda sequence.
  It executes the known cheap targets in easiest-to-hardest order:
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`,
  `Kernel/Monoid.agda`,
  `Verification/Prelude.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeIsolation.agda`,
  with optional bounded inclusion of
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`
  and optional Layer 2 queue generation at the end.
  Sync `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  intended “easy -> bounded -> queue-only” flow explicitly.

## 2026-04-03

- add `scripts/build_selector_step_coarse_bundle.py` as the first repo-native
  bundle builder for the still-open selector commutation probe.
  It reuses the existing Agda-backed orientation-prime adapter from
  `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` and emits a
  `coarse_step` / `step_coarse` bundle suitable for
  `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py`, with optional inline comparison
  output.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the correct
  boundary:
  this is a bridge-aligned runtime probe built from repo-native source, not a
  full independent evaluator of the `shiftCoarse` / `shiftStep` schedule.

- add `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py` as a cheap runtime probe for the
  still-open selector commutation theorem.
  It compares two concrete `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads already interpreted
  as `coarse(step(x))` and `step(coarse(x))`, then reports whether the
  explicit selector agrees on both sides.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the correct
  boundary explicitly:
  this script is for bounded evidence / counterexample search, not theorem
  discharge.

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda` from a pure
  target surface into a theorem-bearing selector lane.
  The selector is now explicit on the 15-prime carrier:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  `selector-sound` is discharged in Agda by a finite upper-bound proof over
  the SSP carrier, while `selector-no-loss-target` and
  `selector-step-coarse-target` remain the honest open targets.
  Recheck `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py` against the same rule and sync
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda` and
  `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py` as the next thin selector surface above
  exponent-level concentration.
  The new Agda module packages the remaining selection boundary explicitly as
  selector soundness, selector no-loss under admissible descent, and
  selector/coarse-step commutation targets.
  The new runtime helper implements the current explicit selector rule:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the selection
  gap as a concrete selector theorem problem rather than a vague concentration
  story.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda` and
  `scripts/check_canonical_prime_concentration.py` as the first exponent-level
  concentration surface above the carrier/bridge/support layers.
  The new Agda module defines
  `PrimeWeight`,
  `PrimeDominates`,
  and `PrimeConcentrated` on the canonical 15-prime carrier, proves weight
  transport across the already-landed coarse/step commutation law, and keeps
  the actual selective claims explicit as target surfaces:
  existence of a concentrated prime and no-loss of concentration under the
  current execution admissibility boundary.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records that the next
  gap is now exponent-level concentration rather than support-level
  invariance.

- add `scripts/route_agda_by_layer.py` as a small execution-policy helper
  above the existing Agda validation and Layer 2 queue surfaces.
  It classifies modules into `L0/L1/L2` and routes them to:
  interactive direct runs,
  bounded direct runs,
  or queue-only handoff for the current heavy Hecke Layer 2 lane.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  control-plane rule explicitly:
  the main win is choosing the right execution boundary around Agda, not
  pretending the heavy aggregate modules belong in the interactive loop.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda` as the first
  light support-level theorem layer above the new canonical prime-selection
  bridge.
  The new module proves transport of prime support across the already-landed
  coarse/step commutation law for the transported prime embedding, and it
  also proves the current support-level no-growth statement over the existing
  execution-admissibility boundary.
  The stronger whole-vector / selective MDL concentration story remains open;
  the new module is intentionally support-level rather than a premature
  prime-image equality claim.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the sharper
  selection boundary correctly.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda` and
  `scripts/check_canonical_prime_selection_bridge.py` as the first real
  implementation of the canonical prime-selection/signature bridge sketched in
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`.
  The new Agda module packages the currently theorem-bearing closure-side
  pieces:
  prime witness on the transported 15-lane carrier,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported prime embedding,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported Hecke signature,
  and the current lower-bound bridge
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`.
  The stronger MDL concentration and non-accidental isolation clauses remain
  explicit open targets there.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records the exact new boundary correctly.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/MoonshinePrimeCarrierMatch.agda` and
  `scripts/check_monster_prime_carrier_match.py` so the repo can now test the
  legal carrier-level version of “our 15 are those 15” without touching the
  heavy Hecke long-compute lane.
  The new Agda surface proves that the intrinsic `SSP` carrier is exactly the
  canonical 15-prime Monster/Ogg list
  `2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71`, and the Python script checks
  the same equality against the runtime-side catalog.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshineMatch.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  correct boundary explicitly:
  carrier/catalog equality is now implemented, while the stronger claim
  equating `forcedStableCount = 15` with the Ogg/Monster prime set remains
  open.

- extend `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` again so emitted
  batch directories are self-indexing.
  It now writes `index.txt` and `index.json` alongside the shell,
  offline-heavy, by-pair, and by-stage artifacts, so external runners or
  humans can inspect the full batch layout from one place.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  self-indexing batch artifact layout explicitly.

- extend `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py` with a small `--dedupe`
  mode so repeated identical command lines can collapse to a unique offline
  command list while preserving first-seen order.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records both
  rendered-script mode and deduped-command mode explicitly.

- add `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py` as the last small control-plane
  wrapper after queue emission.
  It consumes a Layer 2 batch JSON artifact and renders either raw command
  lines or a runnable bash script, so offline handoff no longer requires
  manually extracting `command_template` entries.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  shell -> queue artifact -> rendered command-list flow explicitly.

- extend `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` so it can now write
  concrete batch artifacts to disk, not just print combined output.
  The emitter now materializes:
  `shell.{txt,json}`,
  `offline-heavy.{txt,json}`,
  and grouped offline-heavy files by pair and by stage.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  new offline handoff mode explicitly while keeping the script queue-only.

- refine `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` so it now emits
  separate compile-thin and offline-heavy batches instead of one flat queue.
  The shell batch is centered on
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`;
  the offline-heavy batch keeps the current three predicted pairs in
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  order. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  sharper shell-first / replay-later control flow explicitly.

- add `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` as the control-plane
  emitter for the current saturated Layer 2 speedrun.
  It externalizes the fixed three-pair proof order and the stage order
  `sector -> package -> correlation`, and can attach optional
  `agda --parallel` command templates without running the heavy proof lane.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the next practical use of the sibling
  `../agda` performance ideas correctly:
  bounded deterministic queueing first, heavy replay later.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda` as the true compile-thin
  Layer 2 control surface.
  Unlike `Layer2FiniteSearch.agda`, the shell does not import the heavy
  histogram lane; it postulates the fixed pair/stage targets and packages the
  current order only. Extend
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`
  so `Layer2Open` now carries both:
  the compile-thin shell and the heavier logical finite-search package.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the distinction explicitly:
  logical thinness is not compile thinness, and only the shell is a safe
  interactive Agda check.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearch.agda` as a thin bounded-search
  package over the already-landed Layer 2 proof order.
  It does not add a new Hecke summary surface; it packages the current
  fixed-domain speedrun exactly as
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  on the three predicted saturated-class pairs.
  Extend `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` so
  `Layer2Open` now carries that finite search program explicitly.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the new method boundary correctly:
  the useful lesson from the sibling `../agda` tree is bounded
  proposal/replay-style finite search, not a new invariant layer and not a
  reason to re-run the heavy histogram modules interactively.

- stop treating the old ultrametric signature screen as the execution
  acceptance boundary inside `scripts/regime_test.py`.
  Keep `structural_ok` as a diagnostic field, but switch `joint_ok` and
  `status_class` onto the actual execution-contract clauses the harness
  computes:
  cone,
  MDL/Fejér,
  basin,
  eigen,
  together with arrow.
  Also export the new contract-facing fields (`cone_ok`, `mdl_ok`,
  `execution_non_arrow_ok`, `legacy_*`) so downstream JSON and family
  summaries can distinguish the real acceptance boundary from the old
  signature filter.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records that `regime_test.py` is now on the same
  execution boundary as the new closure-CSV runner.

- wire the new closure-CSV execution-contract runner into the existing batch
  analysis path rather than leaving it as a standalone entrypoint.
  Refactor `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py` into reusable
  evaluation helpers and extend `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` so each
  compatible dataset now records projected-delta execution receipts alongside
  the existing tail-boundary family summaries.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo now records the narrower remaining gap correctly:
  the runner integration is landed, and the residual screening drift lives
  deeper in the older analysis surfaces such as `scripts/regime_test.py`.

- make projection and basin first-class closure-side execution objects rather
  than leaving them only as free predicates inside the contract.
  Add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Projection.agda` for the explicit projection
  carrier plus projected-delta compatibility, add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Basin.agda` for the attractor-relative basin object
  on the projected carrier, and refactor
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContract.agda` to consume both directly
  while preserving the readable receipt layer in
  `ExecutionContractLaws.agda`.
  Add `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py` as the dedicated
  runtime adapter on top of `scripts/execution_contract.py`, so the repo now
  has an explicit closure-CSV execution-contract entrypoint instead of only a
  reusable core enforcer.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records the new boundary correctly:
  projection and basin are now explicit contract objects, and the remaining
  execution gap is no longer “add a runner” but “instantiate these objects
  with richer source-sensitive witnesses”.

## 2026-04-02

- refine the physics-side execution contract instead of inventing a parallel
  execution surface. Add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContractLaws.agda` as a readable receipt/law
  layer above the already-landed `ExecutionContract.agda`, making the five
  obligations explicit:
  arrow,
  projected-delta cone,
  MDL,
  basin,
  eigen overlap.
  Add `scripts/execution_contract.py` as the matching Python projected-delta
  enforcement surface for `closure_embedding_per_step.csv`-style traces. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  execution boundary correctly:
  admissibility is a delta-step contract, not a global `Q(x)` descent rule
  and not a `j-fixed` trace-preservation rule.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/TriadSectorCorrelationRefinement.agda` as the next
  fixed-domain fallback above the ordered triad histogram, and extend
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda` so the same
  three predicted Layer 2 pairs now carry correlation comparison targets as
  well as sector/package histogram targets. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the next refinement step explicitly:
  if the triad-histogram lane collapses, move to sector-correlation rather
  than introducing more totals or broadening the taxonomy.
- re-resolve the canonical archived thread
  `Dashi and Physics Insights`
  (`69ca43a9-09fc-839b-8cc3-e5ce3868eef5`,
  canonical ID `ad17536d8eeb320106585654a0950424abafa93b`, source `db`) and
  sync the repo boundary against it. Record in
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` that its earlier `Forced-Stable Transfer Bridge` priority is now
  historical provenance for the previous bridge phase, while the current live
  bottleneck is the fixed-domain Layer 2 separator problem on the saturated
  branch. Extend `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` so
  the packaged Layer 2 status now includes the explicit predicted proof order
  from `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the exact Layer 2 proof order and add
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`. The repo
  now records the recommended fixed-domain comparison sequence explicitly:
  `balancedCycle` vs `supportCascade`,
  `balancedComposed` vs `supportCascade`, then
  `denseComposed` vs `fullSupportCascade`, all tested sector-by-sector before
  whole-package triad comparison. Keep this comparison surface on the same
  long-compute lane as the other histogram refinement modules.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current progress boundary:
  record explicitly that the repo is now in a "Layer 1 closed / Layer 2 open"
  state. On the current taxonomy, the coarse
  `generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact p2 pressure`
  story is complete; the only live mathematical bottleneck is the next
  separating invariant `I₂` on the current saturated branch. Keep the
  histogram/triad-indexed refinement lane on the long-compute list and avoid
  reframing the repo as a total theory before that branch is discharged.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` to package the
  current Hecke-side status boundary explicitly: Layer 1 is closed on the
  current taxonomy (`generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact
  p2 pressure`), while Layer 2 remains open on the fixed current saturated
  branch (`next separating invariant`). Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo now records the closed-vs-open split directly rather
  than only in prose.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedSectorHistogramComputations.agda` as
  the concrete packaged-data companion to the current fixed-domain
  triad-histogram lane. The module freezes the scope to the already-known
  saturated generator classes and exposes named three-sector histogram
  packages plus the next proof targets in the right order:
  single-sector separation, full packaged separation, or total collapse of
  the packaged refinement on the current scope. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so this module is recorded as a long-compute implementation
  surface rather than an interactively revalidated theorem.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedTriadHistogramSeparation.agda` as the
  current-scope specialization of the triad-indexed refinement lane. The new
  module freezes the domain to the already-classified saturated generator
  taxonomy and states the next honest theorem target there:
  either the triad-indexed histogram separates some current saturated classes,
  or that refinement is exhausted too. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so this fixed-domain triad-histogram question is recorded as the
  next long-compute item rather than an interactively revalidated theorem.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the `3 × 5` refinement boundary:
  record that `Ontology/Hecke/TriadIndexedDefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda`
  now exists as the next candidate refinement surface above the flat current
  orbit-summary histogram, and that
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` now carries both the
  additive `9 + 6` candidate and the multiplicative `3 × 5` factorization on
  the current saturated branch. Keep those Agda checks on the long-compute
  list rather than re-running them interactively.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current `15`-decomposition boundary:
  record that `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` now exist as the first
  implementation surfaces above the collapsed current saturated
  `DefectOrbitSummary`, but that their Agda checks should be treated as
  long-compute items rather than re-run interactively after the prior
  session instability on this class of check.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current saturated `p2` boundary:
  record that `3` is the generative ternary radix while `15` is only the
  current emergent saturated value of the fixed-prime orbit-summary surface.
  The next structural hypothesis is now stated explicitly as explaining or
  decomposing that `15` (for example by a candidate `9 + 6` split), rather
  than treating `15` itself as primitive.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedOrbitSummaryCollapse.agda` to
  strengthen the current saturated-side negative theorem from the
  `forcedStableCount` field to the whole current `DefectOrbitSummary` at
  `p2`. On the full current saturated generator set, the orbit summary
  already collapses to the same fully stable tuple `(15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: the next honest separator
  must come from a richer Hecke-side summary/package than the currently
  landed `DefectOrbitSummary`, or from genuinely new generator classes.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentGeneratorPersistenceRefinement.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` to lift the
  current Hecke-side persistence boundary from the original certified finite
  subset to the full current generator taxonomy. The first module gives every
  currently landed generator class an explicit refinement and exact `p2`
  orbit-pressure value, with `supportCascade` now joining the saturated stay
  branch. The second module packages the matching negative theorem on the
  same scope: every currently saturated generator class already has
  `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present `forcedStableCount`-based summary
  is exhausted as a splitter on the whole current taxonomy. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: find a richer Hecke-side
  summary/package that separates the saturated side, or extend the law only
  when genuinely new generator classes land.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SupportCascadePersistence.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` to push both
  active Hecke-side seams one step further. The first extends the current
  persistence story beyond the original certified finite quotient by proving
  that the mixed-scale `supportCascade` stay-class also has exact
  `forcedStableCount = 15` at `p2`. The second packages the matching negative
  fact on the current saturated certified side: every representative there
  already has `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present orbit-summary
  factorization through that field cannot separate the saturated classes any
  further. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: either extend the `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)` law
  beyond the original certified set, or find a richer Hecke-side summary that
  splits the saturated side.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectPersistenceRefinement.agda` as the next honest
  theorem layer above the certified representative persistence quotient. The
  current exact `p2` data now lands as an explicit refinement law:
  collapse time alone does not determine exact Hecke-side orbit pressure, but
  collapse time plus one Hecke-derived stay refinement does. On the current
  certified set, `explicitWidth1` is `lowStay`,
  `explicitWidth3` and `denseComposed` are `highStay`,
  and the current anchored/immediate representatives are `nonStay`. Also
  extend `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` to
  re-export the corresponding certified refinement factorization through the
  full `DefectOrbitSummary`. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: lift this `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)` law beyond the
  current certified set or split the still-saturated side with a richer
  Hecke-side summary than `forcedStableCount` alone.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativeOrbitSummaryPersistence.agda`
  to lift the current certified representative persistence quotient through
  the full Hecke-side `DefectOrbitSummary`. On the current certified set, the
  persistence tier is now recovered by projecting the summary's
  `forcedStableCount` field, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` now re-exports the
  corresponding certified representative orbit-summary factorization. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: lift these Hecke-determined
  certified quotients beyond the current finite set or separate the current
  saturated classes with a richer summary.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativePersistence.agda` as the first
  genuinely collapse-free numeric quotient on the current certified
  representative set. The exact Hecke-side `forcedStableCountOrbitP2` count
  now determines a small persistence tier on that finite domain:
  `explicitWidth1` lands in `reducedPersistence`, while the rest of the
  current certified anchored/immediate plus the other current stay
  representatives land in `saturatedPersistence`. Also strengthen
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` with a certified
  representative orbit-count factorization through that Hecke-determined
  count band. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: lift this quotient beyond the current certified set or
  replace it with a richer Hecke-determined persistence/summary theorem.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/StaysVsImmediateRepresentativeOrder.agda` as the first
  tiny discharged numeric witness layer above the current exact `p2` count
  modules. The current certified `staysOneMoreStep` representatives are now
  proved `≤` the current certified `immediateExit` representatives at the
  `p2` forced-stable orbit-count level; the same is now true for the current
  `exitToAnchored` representatives; and the guarded orbit-pressure predicates
  in `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` are concretely discharged
  on those certified sets. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  correctly: move from exact representative counts plus current discharged
  order witnesses to a genuinely Hecke-determined numeric persistence or
  quotient law.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ExitToAnchoredRepresentativeComputations.agda` and
  strengthen `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda`
  plus `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` with
  exact current `p2` count theorems. The three current collapse classes are
  now all represented explicitly on the Hecke side:
  current `immediateExit` and `exitToAnchored` representatives normalize to
  `illegalCountP2 = 15` and `forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 15`, while the
  current `staysOneMoreStep` branch splits as
  `explicitWidth1 ↦ forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 2` and
  `explicitWidth3, denseComposed ↦ 15`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated precisely: discharge the guarded
  pressure predicates from these exact count modules instead of searching for
  more representative-state scaffolding.
- extend `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` with
  assumption-guarded theorem surfaces above the current concrete instances,
  and add `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda` so
  the immediate-exit branch mirrors the already-landed stay-class
  representative computations. The pressure-order module now exposes guarded
  numeric orbit-pressure predicates, while the factorization module now
  exposes guarded defect-summary factorization predicates for a future
  Hecke-determined quotient. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  precisely: discharge those success predicates with concrete `p2`
  representative computations instead of adding more coarse scaffolding.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` above the current
  collapse-to-pressure scaffold. The first module enumerates the current
  certified `staysOneMoreStep` classes through the representative-state
  bridge, exposing their representative state, transported prime image,
  computed `p2` orbit summary, and inherited low-pressure tier. The second
  adds the first theorem-bearing order law on the coarse pressure surface:
  `staysOneMoreStep ≤ exitToAnchored ≤ immediateExit`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: move from coarse pressure
  order to genuinely Hecke-determined numeric persistence or quotient laws.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapsePressure.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` above the new
  collapse-time surface. The first module packages a coarse Hecke-side
  pressure classification and representative `p2` pressure summaries above
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda`; the second lands the first
  explicit factorization scaffold from collapse time through that coarse
  defect-pressure summary. Also tighten the comment in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` so `unknownCollapse`
  is recorded as reserved for future classes rather than describing the now
  fully classified current generator set. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  correctly: strengthen the current collapse-to-pressure dictionary into a
  genuinely Hecke-determined persistence or quotient theorem.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` to close the last
  prefix-side classification hole: `explicitWidth1` is no longer
  `boundaryUnknown`, because the one-hot branch stays in the same
  `π-mdl-max` fibre for one more live step. The collapse-time surface is now
  a coarse three-way observable on the current generator classes:
  `immediateExit`, `exitToAnchored`, and `staysOneMoreStep`. Also add
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda` as the first honest
  Hecke-side bridge from that observable: one representative live state per
  generator class, plus the already-proved
  `illegalCount <= forcedStableCount_orbit` lower bound at `p2`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so follow-on work can refine collapse time or strengthen the
  Hecke bridge without restating the current theorem boundary.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda` to connect
  the normalized same-fibre prefix branch and the normalized mixed-scale
  branch into one higher-level generator taxonomy: prefix classes keep
  explicit fourth-step shape labels, while mixed-scale classes keep their own
  normalized trajectory families. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so follow-on work can
  extend one taxonomy instead of growing parallel normalized branches.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMixedScaleTrajectoryFamily.agda`
  to package the mixed-scale trajectory branch into one normalized
  generator-class surface above the same-fibre prefixes: the dense support
  cascade is now the canonical stay-then-exit family, while the full-support
  cascade is the canonical immediate-exit family. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so future work can extend the mixed-scale branch through one
  shared surface instead of treating the two cascade modules as isolated
  trajectory facts.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda`
  from a single fourth-step exit witness into a reusable classifier above the
  normalized generator-class surface: anchored trajectory and explicit
  width-two now certify exits, balanced explicit/composed cycles certify
  exits into the anchored branch, and explicit width-three plus dense
  composed certify one more same-fibre live step. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so future work can extend certified boundaries instead of
  reburying fourth-step behavior inside one trajectory module.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTrajectoryCompositionFamily.agda`
  to package the successful same-carrier 3-state prefixes into one normalized
  generator-class interface: explicit cyclic, balanced cyclic, dense
  composed, balanced composed, and anchored trajectory. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search step can quantify over the shared
  generator surface instead of adding more one-off 3-state modules.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractBalancedComposedFamily.agda` to
  absorb the concrete balanced 3-cycle into the composed-generator lane:
  starting from `fullSupport`, vary one cut mask and one neg-restore mask,
  and the ternary interaction reconstructs the balanced tail cycle exactly.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search target is framed as a new trajectory or
  composition class above the current explicit and first composed families.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadic3CycleInstance.agda` as the
  first fully concrete balanced 3-cycle inhabitant on the live
  `ShiftContractState` carrier: with head fixed at `pos`, the tail cycle
  `(pos , zer , neg) -> (zer , neg , pos) -> (neg , pos , zer)` preserves
  `π-mdl-max` and still splits pairwise at the transported prime image. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next generator search can treat balanced cyclic
  order as a landed same-carrier witness rather than just a design heuristic.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractComposedFamily.agda` as the first
  genuinely compositional same-carrier generator on `ShiftContractState`: a
  ternary interaction rule over base/cut/restore states that already recovers
  the dense width-three cyclic branch exactly. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next generator search is phrased as “go beyond the
  current hand-written and first composed finite families,” not merely “add
  another explicit cyclic witness.”
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStateFamily.agda` as the normalized
  same-carrier family-spec surface on the live `ShiftContractState` carrier:
  generic family record, cyclic-3 specialization, and canonical cyclic
  instances at support widths 1, 2, and 3. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so subsequent generator work can target the shared family
  schema instead of adding ad hoc cyclic witnesses only.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTriadicFamily.agda` to
  normalize the positive explicit cyclic branch on the noncanonical seam into
  one width-indexed surface over support widths 1, 2, and 3. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractFullSupportTrajectory.agda` as a
  distinct seed surface above that branch: the full-support state cascades
  `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1` under the live shift step. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is phrased in terms of new
  generators rather than more local support-width refinements.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractSupportCascadeTrajectory.agda` as
  the first mixed-scale live trajectory on the noncanonical seam: a dense
  seed gives one same-fibre width-three step and then exits through the
  anchored and one-hot fibres as the live dynamics contracts support width
  from 3 to 2 to 1. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is no longer “maybe try
  mixed-scale,” but “go beyond the current explicit cyclic, trajectory, and
  first mixed-scale cascade families.”
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractDenseTriadicFamily.agda` to extend
  the positive explicit-source branch on the noncanonical seam again:
  support width three now also admits a same-carrier triadic family with
  constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is phrased as “go beyond the
  current explicit cyclic/trajectory families,” with explicit cyclic support
  now known at widths 1, 2, and 3.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTailPatternTrajectoryObstruction.agda`
  to close the obvious negative live-step branch on the noncanonical seam:
  the direct neg/pos tail-sign seeds leave the `π-mdl-max` fibre immediately
  under the live shift step. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next noncanonical search stays focused on genuinely new
  cyclic, trajectory, or mixed-scale sources rather than retrying the direct
  tail-pattern seeds.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTrajectoryFamily.agda` as
  the first live-step family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState` seam:
  the anchored support-width-two source now yields a three-state trajectory
  prefix with constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime
  images, and the next live step exits that fibre by collapsing to the one-hot
  fixed point. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to record the corrected boundary: the next noncanonical search
  should go beyond the current explicit cyclic and first trajectory families,
  not merely beyond the one-hot/anchored static families.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTriadicFamily.agda` as the
  second genuine same-carrier family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState`
  seam: keep the coarse head fixed at `pos` and rotate a second active tail
  coordinate. The resulting support-width-two triad still has constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and
  `TODO.md` to record the corrected boundary: the next noncanonical search is
  no longer "go beyond the one-hot triad", but "go beyond the current explicit
  cyclic families" on the same carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadicFamily.agda` to package the
  first genuine same-carrier family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState`
  seam: the three one-hot states form a triadic family with constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and `TODO.md` to record the corrected
  boundary: one-hot states are not globally exhausted, only pairwise one-hot
  probes were; the next task is now to go beyond the landed one-hot triad
  rather than to exclude one-hot support categorically.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` again to sharpen the same noncanonical boundary:
  the next `ShiftContractState` family search is now constrained explicitly by
  the current audits. The repo now records that any viable same-carrier family
  should stay inside one `π-mdl-max` fibre, vary in
  `ker(π-mdl-max) \\ ker(primeImage)`, avoid one-hot/direct-tail and simple
  pair-generated constructions, and most plausibly appear first as a triadic
  or cyclic family rather than another reflection-level probe.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to reflect the new noncanonical boundary cleanly:
  the current `ShiftContractState` seam is no longer a nearby widening
  problem. The bounded same-carrier pools and the immediate
  `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback are now documented as exhausted or blocked,
  so the next honest step is a new same-carrier family/source generator rather
  than more small explicit perturbations or another representation-level lift.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseObservable.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibre.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalMdlP2Control.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowP2ControlCandidate.agda` to
  normalize the next noncanonical control step above the old `π-max`
  obstruction. The repo now packages `mdlLevel × π-max` as a reusable
  noncanonical observable/fibre surface, packages the corresponding narrow
  `p2` control-shape without overstating a positive inhabitant, and packages
  the `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback similarly. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so
  the next step is stated as a positive theorem attempt on `mdlLevel × π-max`,
  not another search for a stronger package.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibreFields.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelP2ControlAttempt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCounterexampleAudit.agda` to
  strengthen that same noncanonical mdl-level lane: the stronger surface now
  has its own fibre-field vocabulary, a first narrow positive theorem
  (package equality determines both `mdlLevel` and the old coarse observable),
  and an explicit audit that the original coarse counterexample pair is no
  longer the active blocker there. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so
  the next gap is stated as finding the new witness or the first genuine
  prime-image/orbit-summary control theorem on `mdlLevel × π-max`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeOrOrbitControl.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelNewWitnessSearch.agda` as
  the next refinement pass on that same surface: no genuine prime-image
  control theorem is landed yet, but the first normalized intermediate theorem
  now exists on the mdl-level fibre, namely that prime equality already
  forces equality of the `p2` orbit-summary coordinate. The bounded witness
  search also records that the retired old coarse pair does not reappear as a
  blocker on this stronger surface. Sync docs/TODO/context so the next gap is
  stated specifically as prime-image control on `mdlLevel × π-max`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelP2PrimeBridge.agda` to
  strengthen that intermediate mdl-level bridge: prime equality on the
  strengthened fibre now explicitly carries the full orbit-summary coordinate
  family along with the already-landed `p2` orbit-summary equality. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyAttempt.agda`
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelChi2WitnessAudit.agda`:
  the first gives an honest singleton-subfamily prime-image theorem, while
  the second records that the current chi2 witness pool lives on the wrong
  carrier for this seam. Sync docs/TODO/context so the remaining gap is still
  prime-image control beyond that trivial subfamily, not summary-level
  consequences once prime equality is known.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSearchAudit.agda`
  to package the bounded same-carrier search state on the strengthened
  `mdlLevel × π-max` surface. The repo now records explicitly that, among the
  current in-repo `ShiftContractState` witnesses, the old coarse pair is
  retired, the certified prime-image subfamily remains the singleton around
  `coarseCounterexampleLeft`, and no fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` /
  unequal-prime-image pair has yet been recovered. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
  so the next step stays focused on prime-image control beyond that bounded
  search scope.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyRefinement.agda`
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSourceAudit.agda`
  to sharpen that same mdl-level boundary without overstating a new control
  theorem. The first wraps the current in-tree witness set into an explicit
  two-point family where the same-state cases are stable and the mixed case is
  already rejected at `π-mdl-max`; the second packages the retired pair,
  singleton subfamily, and bounded search wrappers as an exhausted witness
  source boundary. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda`
  to turn the prepared `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback into a theorem-bearing
  obstruction: even that stronger normalized surface still does not determine
  the canonical `p2` orbit-summary key. Sync docs/TODO/context so the next
  step remains prime-image control beyond the exhausted mdl-level pools, with
  the fallback branch now explicitly obstructed at the canonical `p2` seam.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelExplicitStateSearchAudit.agda`
  to close the obvious direct explicit-state pool on actual
  `ShiftContractState`: the retired coarse pair, one-hot states, and direct
  neg/pos tail patterns are now all recorded as checked without yielding a
  fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` / unequal-prime-image witness. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda`
  to package the higher fallback as a direct no-go control schema: any attempt
  to recover the canonical `p2` orbit-summary from normalized
  `eigenShadow × π-max` equality collapses on the CP/CC witness pair. Sync
  docs/TODO/context so the next step is now clearly “find a genuinely new
  same-carrier family or leave the current fallback ladder,” not “retest the
  obvious pools.”
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to record the stricter closure target and observable split that
  emerged from the current bridge/obstruction results:
  closure now means one carrier, one admissible law, one observable package,
  one RG/coarse-graining story, and one conserved/defect interpretation with
  no unresolved bridge theorem between them. The docs now also state the
  current canonical boundary explicitly:
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` is the strongest landed
  closure→schedule bridge quotient, while bridge-level `mdlLevel`,
  bridge-level `eigenShadow`, raw `eigenSummary`, and raw `heckeSignature`
  remain non-descending on `CP`; these are now documented explicitly as
  fibre/defect data rather than left as undifferentiated failed widenings.
- extend the same docs/TODO pass with the next formalization target for that
  split: define the thin closure fibre over
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, lift Hecke/eigen channels to
  fibre-indexed fields, and target histogram/defect-controlled fibre laws
  before any stronger factorization claim.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibre.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreFields.agda` as the first
  concrete canonical fibre layer over the coarse quotient
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`; the repo now re-exposes raw Hecke/eigen
  channels as fibre-indexed fields and proves the first canonical control law:
  transported illegal/forced-stable counts are constant for fibre
  representatives that agree on the exact pair chamber of the prime-address
  carrier. Sync `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and
  `TODO.md` to record that the next remaining gap is richer
  defect-profile/histogram factorization on those fibres.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreDefectFactorization.agda`
  as the next canonical fibre-law layer: the canonical fibre now carries
  explicit defect-profile, histogram, and orbit-summary fields over the
  transported prime representative. Land the first honest richer-control
  theorems there: illegal chamber entries force stable/zero-drift profile
  behaviour, and the fibre-side forced-stable count is bounded above by the
  orbit-summary stable count. Update docs/TODO so the next remaining gap is
  control/factorization of the actual Hecke/eigen fibre fields, not merely
  their count projections.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreEigenShadowObstruction.agda`
  and record the stronger closure-side classification result it gives:
  `eigenShadow` is not only blocked as a closure→schedule bridge channel, it
  already varies inside the canonical coarse fibre
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` itself. Sync docs/TODO so the next move is
  to control that variation via the landed defect-profile/orbit-summary
  carriers rather than to keep treating `eigenShadow` as a candidate
  descending observable.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda`
  as the first positive control result after that obstruction:
  the richer orbit-summary family already detects the same-fibre `CR`/`CP`
  variation that witnesses `eigenShadow` as genuine fibre data, and the
  single `p2` orbit-summary coordinate already suffices. Update docs/TODO to
  reflect the narrower remaining gap: move from concrete detection to a more
  structural factorization/control theorem.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureCoarseObservable.agda` to turn
  the current canonical boundary into a theorem-bearing module: formalize
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` as the maximal currently bridged coarse
  observable package, factor it through the landed motif-level
  closure→schedule bridge, and package obstruction-facing wrappers for the
  wider bridge shapes that still fail on `CP`.
- strengthen
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda` from
  witness-only separation to a universal canonical-fibre control theorem:
  equality of the `p2` orbit-summary coordinate now forces equality of
  `eigenShadowField` on the canonical coarse fibre. Sync docs/TODO so `p2`
  is now tracked as a genuine control surface on that carrier rather than
  only a diagnostic witness.
- add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  as the first broader noncanonical replay of the observable-transport plus
  prime-compatibility tower on full `ShiftContractState`, recovering the
  witness-level bridge and `illegalCount-chamber ≤ forcedStableCount-hist`
  surface on a larger carrier without changing the current honesty boundary.
- strengthen
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda`
  again by packaging the canonical `p2` control theorem as an explicit
  quotient-facing factor-law surface
  (`P2EigenShadowFactorLaw`, `canonicalP2EigenShadowFactorLaw`) and by
  proving the parallel Hecke-side control theorem
  `p2-controls-hecke-on-canonical-fibre`.
- extend the same canonical fibre-control module with the explicit Hecke
  factor-law packaging
  (`P2HeckeFactorLaw`, `canonicalP2HeckeFactorLaw`) so the existing `p2`
  Hecke control is now surfaced as a quotient-facing record as well.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseObservable.agda` to replay the
  coarse package itself on full `ShiftContractState`: the broader carrier now
  has its own `π-max` into `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, and that
  projection factors through both the observable-transport witness and the
  noncanonical bundle observable surface. Sync docs/TODO/context to reflect
  that the remaining gap has moved from coarse packaging to lifting the
  fibre-control story noncanonically.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseFibre.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseFibreFields.agda` as the first
  noncanonical fibre vocabulary over that broader coarse package: the repo now
  exposes a thin `ShiftContractState` fibre over
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` together with the corresponding
  Hecke/eigen/prime/count/orbit-summary field surface. The remaining
  noncanonical gap is therefore theorem-bearing control, not missing fibre
  carriers or field names.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlObstruction.agda`
  to sharpen that noncanonical gap: the current broader coarse package is
  already too weak for a canonical-style `p2` factor/control law, because two
  explicit `ShiftContractState` values share the same `π-max` image while
  splitting at the transported prime image. The next noncanonical positive
  attempt therefore has to strengthen the invariant package rather than reuse
  the canonical recipe unchanged.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlMdlLevelObstruction.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowNormalizedPackage.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractRGObservableProjection.agda` as the next
  candidate-search round above that obstruction: the cheapest aligned
  strengthening `mdlLevel × π-max` already separates the current obstruction
  pair, `eigenShadow × π-max` does too, and the full normalized shift RG
  observable also separates the pair through the Hecke-signature side. This
  promotes `mdlLevel × π-max` to the next honest starting point for a
  noncanonical control theorem.

## 2026-04-01

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureShiftScheduleBridge.agda`
  with the first honest canonical closure→schedule bridge on a nontrivial
  quotient, namely `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`; also record that the
  larger projected-charge bridge
  `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow` is obstructed on
  the canonical `CP` branch. Sync the reporter-boundary wording in
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, and
  `TODO.md`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureShiftScheduleBridge.agda` and
  sharpen the schedule-bridge roadmap in `TODO.md` plus
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`: the minimal transported
  closure→shift schedule surface is now explicit, and the stronger raw-eigen
  closure/schedule bridge shape is now proved obstructed on the canonical
  `CP` branch.
- add `canonicalEigenLevel-CP-obstructed` to
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, making
  the canonical raw-`eigenSummary` obstruction proof-bearing rather than only
  narrative; this sharpens the current AGMB boundary that
  `eigenShadow = (earth , hub)` is the strongest landed closure-honest
  quotient on the tiny `CR/CP/CC` carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the bundle-level
  `ObservableTransportWitness` lift is now exercised concretely on the
  canonical abstract gauge/matter bundle carrier, via
  `canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
- repair the canonical AGMB continuum lane in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda` by making
  `ContinuumWitness` preserve a projected continuum observable rather than the
  full transported `RGObservable`; the canonical instance now compiles again
  with the closure-honest target
  `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow`, where
  `eigenShadow = (earth , hub)` is the first nontrivial preserved quotient of
  `eigenSummary`, while the stronger
  full-observable target remains explicitly blocked on the `CP` branch.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStatePrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the transported-profile route now
  also has a full execution-contract carrier instance:
  `EC.Contract.State (shiftContract {1}{3})` now instantiates both
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist` and the orbit-side
  forced-stable bridge through
  `canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftGeoVPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the transported-profile route now
  has a genuinely broader concrete carrier: the full `ShiftGeoV` state family
  now instantiates both the witness-level inequality
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`
  and the orbit-side forced-stable bridge, rather than only the tiny canonical
  `CR/CP/CC` carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalTransportedPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the generic transported-profile
  constructor is now exercised concretely on the canonical carrier and shown to
  agree with the closure-native `CR/CP/CC` prime embedding.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so bundle-level closure carriers can
  now inherit the minimal witness bridge whenever they already export an
  `ObservableTransportWitness` and a target-side prime embedding.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TransportedPrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda` and
  extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so any closure family with a transported
  `State -> FactorVec` image can now recover the same witness-level bridge
  surface by forgetting multiplicity and keeping only prime-lane presence.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda` and refactor
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalChamberToShiftWitnessBridgeInstance.agda`
  through it, so closure-native compatibility data now has a reusable path to
  prime embeddings, illegal masks, and witness-level forced-stable bridges
  instead of being wired only as a one-off canonical table.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalChamberToShiftWitnessBridgeInstance.agda`
  and extend `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the smaller witness-level
  bridge now has a first concrete canonical inhabitant. This gives a real
  canonical proof of `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`, and it
  now computes the compatibility mask from a closure-native profile on the
  three-generator canonical carrier, with the transported shift image retained
  only as an audit equality.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ChamberToShiftWitnessBridge.agda` and extend
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo now has the minimal fixed-prime witness bridge:
  closure-side illegal mask,
  shift-side forced-stable witness mask,
  and the aggregate theorem
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`
  derived from pointwise witness soundness.
- weaken `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` ContinuumWitness
  by removing `scaleFromCarrier` and preservation laws, and adjust
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  accordingly. Docs/TODO now reflect that the canonical AGMB instance compiles
  under the weaker continuum surface; stronger continuum targets remain
  blocked because the current closure-derived law does not preserve
  `canonicalRGObservableOf` on the `CP` branch.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalForcedStableTransferBridgeInstance.agda`
  and extend `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the forced-stable bridge
  ladder now has a first concrete canonical inhabitant using the existing map
  `canonicalTransportState -> canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
  This instantiates the orbit-side inequality on the canonical closure carrier,
  but the chamber count is still defined from the transported shift image, so
  the bridge is concrete without yet being closure-native.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableTransferBridge.agda` and update
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the current bridge ladder is now explicit code rather than only
  a note:
  exact-chamber illegal-count constancy,
  an abstract closure-to-shift lower bound
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`,
  and the derived composed bound
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_orbit`.
  The closure-to-shift bridge map itself is still not inhabited.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `TODO.md`, and `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`
  after the refreshed pull of archived thread `Dashi and Physics Insights` to
  record the current bridge-sequencing target as
  `illegalCount_chamber ≤ forcedStableCount_hist ≤ forcedStableCount_orbit`, with
  `S(x)` the closure→shift transport image and a preferred first goal of
  `illegalCount_chamber(x,p) ≤ forcedStableCount_hist(S(x),p)`.
- add a reminder that the physics-facing story must stay on the representation
  layer until the canonical closure-to-shift schedule bridge is proven and the
  raw `heckeSignature`/`eigenSummary` obstructions are resolved; this keeps
  reporter claims grounded in the formal inequality ladder rather than an
  unproven conserved observable.

## 2026-03-31

- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectProfileCorrespondence.agda` and
  extend `Docs/HeckeDefectProfileCorrespondence.md` so the chamber-side
  illegal-mode restriction now lifts from coarse defect classes to the full
  defect-profile correspondence: illegal entries are forced to have zero
  signature drift, fixed motif, and `Stable` coarse defect throughout an exact
  chamber.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecOrbitForcedStableLowerBound.agda` and extend
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md` so the first orbit-summary component is
  now constrained honestly: the histogram-layer forced-stable / illegal count
  is a lower bound for the orbit-summary `forcedStableCount` field, because
  illegal entries are always Stable at the full defect-profile level even
  though not every Stable profile entry is forced by illegality.
- update `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`, and `TODO.md` to pin down the
  current eigen-side widening blocker more precisely: the live
  `shiftEigenSchedule` theorem exists only on the shift carrier, and there is
  still no canonical closure-to-shift schedule bridge from the closure-derived
  law `x ↦ [ CR , x ]` into that live schedule.
- update `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to record the current full Hecke-side stack more
  accurately:
  exact legality-signature chambers are already landed locally, while
  compressed chamber quotients, orbit families, correspondence algebra,
  weighted operators, spectral structure, and any bridge to the contractive
  physics bundle remain open. The next explicit Hecke-side target is now
  histogram-level chamber stability on the defect correspondence fiber rather
  than another abstract transport surface.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectHistograms.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectHistograms.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeDefectHistograms.md` as the first histogram layer above the
  15-entry defect correspondence fiber; the repo now extracts full
  defect-class histograms and proves chamber-stability for the forced-stable /
  illegal count, without yet claiming that the full histogram is chamber
  invariant.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecHistogramObstruction.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeDefectHistogramObstruction.md` to record a concrete small
  counterexample showing that the full defect histogram is not determined by
  the exact legality-signature data alone; the forced-stable / illegal count
  remains the strongest proved chamber-invariant histogram component.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectOrbitSummaries.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md` as the first orbit-style summary layer
  above the full defect-profile correspondence, compressing each target-prime
  fiber to drift, motif-change, and coarse defect-count statistics without yet
  claiming chamber or transport invariance for that summary carrier.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda` to record that
  the first orbit-style summary layer is also not determined by legality-
  signature data alone; the current counterexample already separates the full
  orbit summary on the same small `p7 = 2` versus `p7 = 3` family.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ReverseRepresentation.agda` plus
  `Docs/ReverseHeckeRepresentation.md` as the first local implementation of
  the archived reverse-Hecke idea, explicitly on the representation layer and
  not in the contractive conserved-witness bundle.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/QuotientRepresentation.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeQuotientRepresentation.md` as the first local equivalence/setoid
  and quotient-facing Hecke interface, again on the representation layer and
  not in the contractive closure bundle.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecInstances.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecHeckeInstance.md` as the first concrete representation-layer
  Hecke inhabitant on the existing 15-prime factor-vector carrier.
- strengthen that first concrete `FactorVec` inhabitant with a genuinely
  coarser quotient carrier, `SupportMask`, so the representation-layer Hecke
  path now has more than the trivial equality quotient.
- strengthen the same `FactorVec` inhabitant again with a richer alternate
  transport family, `flowPrime`, which acts on the selected prime lane and the
  next prime lane in the fixed Monster ordering.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SignedTransport.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecSignedTransport.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecSignedTransport.md` as the first signed multi-lane transport
  law on the prime-address carrier, with explicit legality and a fine
  equality-quotient descended action.
- clarify that the signed `FactorVec` transport still does not descend to a
  finite coarse multiplicity quotient, so the current strongest honest
  statement remains: exact signed transport descends on the fine equality
  quotient but not on the coarser support-style quotients.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SignedTransportObstruction.agda` as a concrete
  counterexample module showing that support-mask equivalence is not preserved
  by the signed decrement-plus-increment transport.
- strengthen that obstruction module with a general proof that positive bounded
  saturation quotients of the form `e ↦ min(e, K)` also fail to respect the
  signed decrement-plus-increment transport.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecSignedScan.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecSignedScan.md` to attach the signed transport family to the
  existing Hecke scan and motif pipeline surfaces on the representation layer.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/MultiLaneSignedTransport.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneTransport.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecMultiLaneTransport.md` as the first reusable mode-labelled
  multi-lane signed-transport interface and concrete `FactorVec` inhabitant.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/TransportChambers.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecTransportChambers.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecTransportChambers.md` as the first exact chamber surface for
  the multi-lane `FactorVec` transport stack, using full `PairMode` legality
  signatures rather than an overcompressed threshold quotient.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.md` as the first pre/post signed-scan defect
  layer for the multi-lane `FactorVec` transport stack, classifying
  scan-visible behavior into `Stable`, `Repatterning`, `Contractive`, and
  `Expansive`.
- strengthen `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.agda` with explicit
  illegal-mode stability lemmas, and add
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectRestrictions.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecChamberDefectRestrictions.md` as the first theorem bridge
  from exact chamber agreement to defect behavior: illegal modes force
  `Stable` defects throughout an exact chamber.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CorrespondenceRepresentation.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecCorrespondence.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeCorrespondenceRepresentation.md` as the first genuine finite
  correspondence-class Hecke operator on the representation layer, with a
  true sum-over-fiber action on the `SupportMask` quotient carrier.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectCorrespondenceRepresentation.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectCorrespondence.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeDefectCorrespondence.md` as the first scan/defect-derived finite
  correspondence family and averaging operator on the representation layer.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectProfileCorrespondence.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectCorrespondence.agda`,
  `Docs/HeckeDefectProfileCorrespondence.md`, and
  `Docs/HeckeChamberDefectCorrespondence.md` to lift the defect-derived
  correspondence from coarse defect classes to full finite profiles and to
  state the first chamber-side restriction directly on correspondence entries.
- add `Ontology/DNA/Supervoxel4Adic.agda`,
  `Ontology/DNA/ChemistryQuotient.agda`, and
  `Docs/DNASupervoxelHierarchy.md` to start a local DNA-first 4-adic
  supervoxel lane with a chemistry-visible quotient surface on `DNA256`.
- add `Ontology/DNA/ChemistryConcrete.agda` as the first concrete chemistry
  quotient instance on `DNA256`, with a `U/V` feature map, strong-base thermo
  count, and local immediate repeat/complement admissibility screen.
- strengthen that concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance with a bounded
  nonlocal complement rule at span 2, so the thermo/admissibility surface is
  no longer purely nearest-neighbor.
- strengthen the same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 4-window GC-extremal ban, so the admissibility screen now includes a
  first local GC-balance constraint in addition to repeat/complement checks.
- strengthen that same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 4-window reverse-complement palindrome ban, so the admissibility and
  thermo surfaces now include a first explicitly DNA-specific reverse-
  complement screen beyond the earlier span-2 rule.
- strengthen that same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 6-window hairpin-style reverse-complement screen, so the bounded
  thermo surface now includes a first explicitly hairpin-flavored local law.
- add `Docs/PhysicsArchiveCoverageMap.md` and update
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` with the current local-DB archive coverage map for
  the physics-closure program, including canonical thread metadata and the
  current repo-facing priority order:
  derived dynamics law,
  realization-independent projection/delta theorem,
  signature forcing / execution-delta interface,
  continuum scaling law,
  then the physical reality bridge from wavefield / phase synchronization.
- update `README.md` and `TODO.md` so the same archive-backed lane split is
  now explicit in public status and roadmap files, with the light-transport /
  phase-sync material treated as P1 support work and moonshine-adjacent
  material kept off the critical physics path unless it directly reduces a P0
  proof gap.
- strengthen the abstract recovery theorem surface again by making transported
  projection/Δ compatibility part of `GaugeMatterRecoveryTheorem` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`; the canonical bundle
  inhabitant now supplies that proof payload directly, and the surrounding
  bundle/gap docs and TODOs now record that this seam is no longer only a
  parallel export.
- strengthen that same recovery theorem surface again so it now carries both
  the base and alternate transported projection/Δ schedule families rather
  than only one target-side family; the canonical bundle instance exports both
  through recovery-level conversion helpers.

## 2026-03-30

- add a second live-shift inhabitant of the reusable
  `TransportedProjectionDeltaWitness` surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, covering
  the alternate phase schedule pair
  (`shiftCoarseAlt ∘ step`, `step ∘ shiftCoarseAlt`) alongside the original
  base pair.
- generalize the new target-side projection/Δ lane into a reusable bundle-layer
  theorem surface by adding `TransportedProjectionDeltaWitness` plus
  `toTransportedProjectionDeltaCompatibility` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`; the canonical
  shift-target witness now inhabits that generic surface.
- add a first transport-attached target-side projection/Δ witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, so the
  canonical bundle now exports the live shift carrier schedules
  (`shiftCoarse ∘ step`, `shiftCoarseAlt`) and cone transport lemmas through
  the existing observable transport layer.
- strengthen the canonical bundle-side projection/Δ lane in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda` with a
  second, quotient-sensitive witness over the transported live
  `RGObservable`, reusing the shift RG lane’s `Observable≈` quotient instead
  of only plain equality on the full bundle observable.
- lift the new `ProjectionDeltaCompatibility` surface into
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` by extending
  `NaturalDynamicsWitness` with offset admissibility/cone preservation and
  exporting `toProjectionDeltaCompatibility`; the canonical bundle instance
  now exposes `canonicalBundleProjectionDeltaCompatibility`.
- add an explicit projection/delta abstraction surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/RGObservableInvariance.agda` as
  `ProjectionDeltaCompatibility`, then instantiate it from the live shift RG
  schedules in `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda` so the
  projection/Δ lane is no longer only a documentation target.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  so the canonical bundle's `mdlLevel` is no longer a constant-zero placeholder
  but is instead read from the transported live `RGObservable` imported from
  `shiftRGSurface`; keep the cone witness intentionally trivial at this layer
  because the current carrier dynamics is still synthetic and does not yet
  justify a shift-derived cone-preservation theorem.
- replace the synthetic three-cycle in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first closure-derived carrier law, namely the canonical bracket
  action `x ↦ [ CR , x ]`; this keeps the bundle nontrivial while tying the
  dynamics to the actual canonical closure package rather than a hand-chosen
  carrier permutation.
- strengthen that same canonical abstract bundle instance again so the
  conserved witness is no longer gauge-only but now carries the first stable
  transported RG payload under the closure-derived law:
  `Gauge × mdlLevel × motifClass`.
- strengthen the abstract continuum lane so `ContinuumWitness` now carries an
  explicit limit carrier, scaling map, limit-side MDL readout, and limit-side
  cone witness rather than only a bare `limitObservable`; inhabit that stronger
  surface canonically in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`.
- connect the already-landed offset-universality abstraction back into the
  abstract bundle layer by exporting `GaugeMatterRecoveryTheorem` as an
  `ObservableRGOffsetUniversality` witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`, and expose that
  converted witness from the canonical abstract bundle instance.
- strengthen the canonical continuum inhabitant again so its limit carrier is
  now the transported `RGObservable` rather than the whole
  `Gauge × RGObservable` field; the first continuum scaling law therefore
  quotients away the gauge wrapper instead of merely rewrapping the same
  finite bundle object.
- update `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md`, `Docs/ContinuumLimit.md`,
  `Docs/GaugeMatterCapstone.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next promotion
  gates are explicit: possible widening beyond the current conserved
  `mdlLevel`/`motifClass` witness, bundle-level integration of the already-
  landed offset-universality surface, and a less finite/repackaged continuum
  carrier/scaling law.
- added the moonshine-primes proof-planning stack:
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeNullModels.md`,
  `Docs/CarrierFactorization.md`,
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshineMatch.md`,
  `Docs/PrimeToModular.md`,
  and `Docs/MoonshineProofChecklist.md`,
  so the repo now has a staged proof program with definitions, null tests,
  carrier hypotheses, legal Monster-comparison forms, and explicit promotion
  gates.
- tightened `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md` with the executable schema contract
  for the first implementation surface:
  accepted JSON fields, normalized quotient output, and the exact observable
  summary needed before null models or prime-selection tests can run.
- added `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md` and cleaned
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md` so the physics-gap story now matches the
  repo:
  execution, basin, cone, and signature surfaces already exist, but several
  of the strongest witnesses remain canonical-only or partially trivialized,
  with the highest-priority gap now stated as the execution/eigen bridge into
  the abstract bundle layer.
- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftExecutionInvariantCore.agda` as a shared
  shift-side invariant core:
  it computes the canonical shift Hecke/signature/eigen payload below both the
  execution and RG layers so execution-side eigen witnesses no longer have to
  stay at the constant-zero placeholder level.
- strengthened
  `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda` so the canonical `(1,3)`
  execution contract now uses that shared core for its eigen witness and keeps
  the noncanonical fallback branch explicitly trivial rather than implicitly
  pretending to carry the same proof mass.
- extended
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`
  with `SignatureLockWitness`, and strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  so the canonical bundle inhabitant now carries:
  - a shift-derived canonical signature/eigen payload from the shared core,
  - and a `sig31`-locked signature witness on the abstract bundle surface.
- revalidated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda` on its own
  theorem path after making the canonical basin transport explicit, then
  replaced the synthetic RG payload in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the observed value of the live `shiftRGSurface` at
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness`, so the abstract bundle now carries a real
  anchor-state import from the shift RG surface rather than a locally
  manufactured placeholder observable.
- extended
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`
  with `ObservableTransportWitness` and strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first carrier-level observable transport inhabitant:
  the canonical bundle now transports every carrier point into an external
  shift-RG target carrier and proves admissible-state soundness of that
  transport, while still keeping the target-side map explicitly constant at
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness`.
- strengthened that first transport inhabitant further:
  the canonical observable transport now factors through the concrete
  three-generator carrier (`CR`, `CP`, `CC`) and chooses among three
  shift-side representatives.
- tightened the canonical bundle observable layer so it now follows the
  transported shift state itself rather than carrying one fixed RG payload:
  the abstract bundle transport is therefore sensitive at the
  `RGObservable` level, while the surrounding canonical bundle dynamics remain
  the minimal identity dynamics.
- replaced those identity bundle dynamics in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first non-identity carrier law on the concrete canonical carrier:
  a three-cycle `CR -> CP -> CC -> CR`, while narrowing the conserved witness
  to the gauge charge and letting the transported RG observable vary with the
  chosen shift-side target.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_object.py` as the first executable schema for
  the moonshine-primes program:
  it parses one `MoonshinePrimeState` JSON payload and emits the normalized
  quotient object (`factorSupport`, support weight, signature, eigen summary,
  basin label, and denominator fields) required by the later null-model and
  prime-selection lanes.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_nulls.py` as the first executable null-model
  harness for the moonshine-primes program:
  it runs schema-level random-partition, ternary-state, matched-support, and
  randomized-rotation controls, computes empirical `p`-values, and emits the
  stop-rule verdict needed before any Monster comparison logic.
- tightened the next grounding step for that program:
  the moonshine-prime schema should now be attached to a repo-native emitted
  state source (starting with the canonical shift example JSONs) before the
  null-model lane is widened further.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_prototype.py` to adapt the canonical
  emitted prototype states into `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads, and validated
  the full path on `scripts/examples/near_miss_state.json`; on that grounded
  example the target-prime support is empty (`47,59,71` absent), so the
  null-model stop rule remains triggered as it should.
- added `Docs/MoonshinePrimeSource.md` to separate the moonshine-prime program
  from the photonuclear lane and name the first repo-native source-family
  candidates under `DASHI/Physics/Moonshine`.
- fixed the first moonshine-native adapter boundary in
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeSource.md`:
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda` can first be consumed as an
  orientation-prime source before any stronger fixed-count trace extraction is
  claimed.
- tightened that moonshine-native source contract further:
  the first executable adapter is explicitly restricted to an
  `orientation_prime_only` state lifted from
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda`, with provenance but without any invented
  full-trace or modular semantics.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` as the first
  moonshine-native adapter:
  it extracts the explicit `just 31` orientation hook from
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda`, emits a minimal
  `MoonshinePrimeState` payload marked `orientation_prime_only`, and validates
  cleanly through `scripts/moonshine_prime_object.py` to the normalized
  quotient object with factor support `{31}`.
- tightened the next moonshine-native strengthening rule:
  richer finite-twined report/bundle fields may now be attached as auxiliary
  metadata, but they still must not silently alter the normalized
  moonshine-prime observable until a documented lift exists.
- strengthened `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` to attach
  auxiliary finite-twined report metadata drawn from
  `FiniteTwinedTraceDetailedReport.agda`,
  `MoonshineTraceFamilySummary.agda`,
  `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle.agda`, and
  `FiniteTwinerLibraryShift.agda`:
  the emitted state now carries explicit verdict-slot counts, extra-verdict
  counts, compared-twiner counts, and labeled shift twiner names under
  `traceReport` while the normalized observable remains conservatively pinned
  to factor support `{31}`.
- added the `P0` gauge/matter recovery documentation stack:
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md`,
  `Docs/NaturalDynamicsLaw.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  `Docs/ContinuumLimit.md`,
  `Docs/GaugeMatterCapstone.md`,
  and `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  so the weakest physics block now has an explicit theorem/program breakdown
  and a named next implementation seam.
- clarified the first planned inhabitant of the abstract gauge/matter bundle:
  the current canonical constraint/gauge package lifted through identity
  dynamics with the gauge label treated as the first conserved observable.
- tightened the next follow-up on that bundle:
  the first strengthening should import the `RGObservable` surface as a minimal
  typed payload alongside the gauge label, rather than faking a shift-side RG
  computation on the canonical constraint carrier.
- narrowed that strengthening further:
  the first honest transported payload should come from the real shift RG
  surface evaluated at `canonicalShiftStateWitness`, making the lift
  anchor-state-based rather than purely synthetic.
- added `Docs/TriadicCarrierToSU3.md` to state the safe bridge from a triadic
  3-sector carrier to an `SU(3)`-like internal symmetry candidate, including
  the required extra assumptions (Hermitian norm preservation,
  determinant-one admissible mixing, observable quotient).
- added `Docs/MusicalSymmetryMDL.md` plus
  `scripts/musical_symmetry_mdl.py` to replace the earlier symmetry-reward toy
  target with the stronger MDL/compression basin target:
  contraction plus a compression proxy, without explicit symmetry reward.
- added `Docs/ColourInDashi.md` to make the colour-language claim boundary
  explicit:
  optical colour is treated as a projection-stable observable on a structured
  latent signal, perceptual colour is kept separate as an organized
  interpretation/reconstruction layer, and QCD colour is not collapsed into the
  same formal object.
- updated repo-facing context/docs so MDL reconstruction, ultrametric geometry,
  and cone-screened dynamics are described as internal Dashi structure on
  encoded colour states rather than as finished empirical theorems about human
  colour perception.
- added the photonuclear prototype documentation stack:
  `Docs/PhotonBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CMSPhotonuclearBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CharmPhotoproduction.md`,
  `Docs/SaturationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/CMSCapstone.md`,
  `Docs/NumericObservableInterface.md`,
  `Docs/GBWResponse.md`,
  `Docs/ModelComparison.md`,
  `Docs/PrototypeRunner.md`,
  and `Docs/PrototypeExamples.md`.
- added the first executable surrogate prototype surface:
  `scripts/prototype_schema.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_gbw.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_ipsat.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_runner.py`,
  `scripts/compare_prototype_channels.py`,
  and `scripts/compare_surrogate_models.py`.
- added hand-constructed example states for qualitative explanatory inspection:
  `scripts/examples/near_miss_state.json` and
  `scripts/examples/head_on_state.json`.
- added `scripts/prototype_matrix.py` as the first batch prediction matrix over
  example states and reduced model families, making the prototype compare
  channel-to-channel and model-to-model explanations without performing fitting
  or claiming empirical validation.
- replaced the prototype's freehand example-fixture plan with an emitted
  shift-path example plan:
  docs/TODO now anchor prototype example states to
  `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda::canonicalShiftStateWitness`
  and `ShiftInBasin`, and a dedicated emitter script materializes the example
  JSON files from that named provenance surface.
- taught the comparison/matrix runner layer to auto-refresh the canonical
  emitted example files when those documented example paths are missing or
  stale relative to `scripts/emit_shift_prototype_examples.py`.
- added a shared non-fitting explanation scorecard in
  `scripts/prototype_scorecard.py` and threaded it into the comparison/model
  inspection surfaces so “better explanation” is now defined in terms of
  normalized residual, MDL burden, and surrogate-confidence penalty rather
  than empirical fit claims.

## 2026-03-27

- recorded PR `#1` (`nix support`) as the active source merge target for the
  missing Agda surface in this checkout and documented the exact modules and
  perf wiring it contributes.
- merged the source-level Agda additions from that patchset into the local
  tree: `Kernel/KAlgebra.agda`, `Monster/MUltrametric.agda`, `Moonshine.agda`,
  `MoonshineEarn.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`, `PerfHistory.agda`, `perf_da51.py`,
  `agda_da51_source.jsonl`, `agda_da51_traces.jsonl`, and the related import
  rewrites.

## 2026-03-25

- added [`MONSTER10WALK_INTAKE.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/MONSTER10WALK_INTAKE.md)
  to pin the local source hierarchy for the Monster 10-walk thread:
  upstream `monster/experiments/bott_periodicity/monster_walk.tex` as the
  source table, plus sibling-repo
  `../FRACDASH/MONSTER10WALK_CANONICAL.md` and
  `../FRACDASH/JMD_HANDOFF_NOTE.md` as the current local executable
  interpretation and claim-boundary notes.
- updated [`fracdash-impl/README.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/fracdash-impl/README.md)
  so the FRACDASH bridge note points directly at the new Monster 10-walk
  intake document instead of leaving that cross-repo dependency implicit.

## 2026-03-23

- added a local merge-prep Nix / zkperf tooling surface for upstream PR-style
  integration work:
  `flake.nix` now exposes an authoritative check that mirrors the existing
  GitHub CI route through `DASHI/Everything.agda`, a second recursive
  `merge-smoke` check for merge-relevant standalone roots plus recursive
  `Kernel/`, `Monster/`, and `Verification/` modules, and a dev shell with
  `agda-record` / `agda-record-all`.
- added `dashi-agda.agda-lib` as an explicit local library surface for that
  tooling.
- added `scripts/list_merge_agda_targets.sh` and
  `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh` so the recursive merge-prep target surface
  is explicit, deterministic, and reusable by both the smoke check and
  `agda-record-all`.
- documented the merge-policy decision that DA51 / zkperf JSONL demo artifacts
  are acceptable for now as illustrative witness outputs, but should be read
  as non-authoritative sample data rather than canonical reproducibility
  fixtures.
- validated the new local surface with:
  shell syntax checks for the helper scripts,
  deterministic target-list output,
  representative Agda checks on `ActionMonotonicity.agda` and
  `Monster/Projection.agda`,
  and one full successful run of `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh`
  covering `20` merge-smoke targets.
- generated `flake.lock` from the new merge-prep flake inputs and then fixed
  the first Nix-build failure:
  the original authoritative and merge-smoke derivations tried to let Agda
  write `_build/*.agdai` into the read-only Nix source tree, so the flake
  checks now stage the repo into a writable temp directory before typechecking.
  The flake also now uses `pkgs.perf` instead of the deprecated
  `linuxPackages.perf` alias.
- fixed the next authoritative Nix failure too:
  the derivation now provides a UTF-8 locale through `glibcLocales` and
  `LOCALE_ARCHIVE`/`LANG`/`LC_ALL`, so Agda's Unicode-bearing diagnostics no
  longer fail inside the Nix sandbox on modules such as
  `DASHI/Algebra/MonsterUltrametric15.agda`.
- closed out the merge-prep Nix / zkperf surface after a successful local
  `nix flake check`, `nix build .#check`, and `nix build .#merge-smoke` run
  on the locked flake; the merge-prep tooling is now considered complete and
  the repo returns to the physics closure priorities tracked in `TODO.md`.
- trimmed the canonical closure export surface by removing the legacy
  assumption-first closure instance from the public
  `PhysicsClosureSummary`/`Everything` path while keeping the compatibility
  module on disk, and dropped the empirical-to-full adapter from the umbrella
  import too; the outside-wired full-closure and provider-based constructors
  are now labeled as legacy adapters.
- routed `physicsClosureFullFromCoreWitness` directly from the core witness,
  removing the last canonical bounce through the legacy external adapter.
- routed the canonical contraction→quadratic theorem constructor through the
  strong package’s canonical identity witness, reducing duplicated split
  construction on the canonical path.
- promoted the remaining theorem-checklist / bridge-package seam to the
  direct core-witness route as a tracked follow-up, so the long-running
  closure-spine cleanup stays explicit in `TODO.md`.

## 2026-03-25

- recorded the SL ↔ DA51 ↔ Agda contract in `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` and
  `DASHI/HME/Trace.agda` so the proof layer only consumes `TraceWitness`,
  `CanonicalWitness`, and `ProofStatus` records without touching closure
  semantics.
- added `scripts/hme_pipeline.py` to normalize DA51 traces, compute entropy/MDL
  proxies, score cone similarity against multi-attractor candidates, cluster via
  k-means, and measure silhouette/invariance metrics (hot/cold/basin metadata
  remains in the invariants bundle).
- added `scripts/hme_cli.py` plus `scripts/hme_emit_agda.py` to emit canonical
  witness JSON, cluster metrics, and invariance scores from actual DA51 inputs
  and to regenerate `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` so Agda can import
  real data without a runtime parser; `scripts/TODO.md` now tracks running these
  scripts against the curated trace JSON plus wiring `WitnessBundle` into a
  downstream module.
- ingested the QG/SL smoke payload via `SensibLaw/scripts/qg_unification_smoke.py`,
  stored the raw output plus reconstructed `qg_trace.json` and `qg_witness.json`
  under `scripts/data/`, and refreshed `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda`
  so the canonical witness matches the actual QG smoke trace.
- added `scripts/data/demo_traces.json` as a known-good DA51 trace sample, ran
  the CLI/codegen to produce `scripts/data/demo_witness.json` and the generated
  module, and introduced `DASHI/HME/Integration.agda` to show how to plug
  `canonicalWitnesses` into a `WitnessBundle` paired with an existing `Admissible`
  path so Casey/SL can consume a real proof data pair.

## 2026-03-27

- Confirmed the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` is present locally and recorded
  its exact scope: a small Lean-side perf/CBOR witness repo with
  `Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `MoonshineEarn.lean`, and
  `DashiPerf/*`, but not the missing DASL class/projection layer.
- Updated the compactified context and TODO state so future bridge work treats
  `../dashi_lean4` as an auxiliary Lean witness repo, not as the source-side
  anchor or as a replacement for `../kant-zk-pastebin`.

## 2026-03-22

- checked the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` against the current JMD-side gap
  and recorded the negative result:
  it is useful as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema witness, but it does not
  provide the missing DASL class/projection layer
  (`EigenSpace`, Bott/Hecke/orbifold class table, or source projection for
  the HEPData families), so `../kant-zk-pastebin` remains the relevant
  source-side anchor.
- promoted the family-level execution taxonomy into the Agda witness layer:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` now carries `FamilyClass`,
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentFamilyWitness.agda` exports the observed
  family classifications, and that family witness is threaded through
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`, `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, and
  `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure`.
- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TailBoundaryLemma.agda` as a theorem-facing
  current-witness module for the `mdl_tail_boundary` regime and extended
  `scripts/regime_test.py` with a `tail_boundary_lemma_latest.json` summary.
  On the current larger `dashifine` family set that summary reports
  `1` `mdl_tail_boundary` family out of `9`, with the current case
  tail-localized, terminal-boundary, cone/Fejér/closest-point admissible,
  and failing only at the MDL-exact layer.
- added `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` to aggregate the same regime across
  all currently compatible `dashifine` batches and wrote
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_batch_latest.json`.
  Current widened count is `2` `mdl_tail_boundary` instances across `3`
  datasets, still with only one unique family (`ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`), and
  both observed instances remain tail-localized and terminal-boundary.
- extended that batch aggregate with cohort/control summaries:
  repeated `pTll` families plus `dijet_chi_7tev_cms` and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas` stay interior,
  `phistar_50_76` repeats as `arrow_ladder`,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` repeats as `single_arrow_break`,
  and only `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` repeats as `mdl_tail_boundary`.
- extended the same aggregate with a compatible-dataset inventory:
  the current local `dashifine` search space contains `3` compatible step
  files and `7` tail-candidate families, of which only
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` currently leave the interior.
- refreshed the focused `z_pt_7tev_atlas` family export and recorded the
  narrower read:
  it remains a `single_arrow_break`, not a second `mdl_tail_boundary`;
  current run shows one late tail-localized arrow-only boundary step at
  `t=9->10` with `arrow_delta≈0.0305551`, all tested `v_dnorm` variants still
  nonincreasing, and clearance under the `lenient` arrow profile.
- added the first focused still-interior heavy-spectrum check:
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev` stays fully interior on the all-batch run with
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
- added the next focused heavy-spectrum control check:
  `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev` also stays fully interior on the all-batch run with
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
- pulled archived context for `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`
  (online UUID `69bf03e8-7634-839b-a9fd-74ed3616943f`,
  canonical thread `cff5c44711a788e01cdbadd98a72822ce1bb8786`) into the
  canonical archive and recorded the decision in `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`.
- tightened repo-facing symmetry language in `README.md` and
  `Docs/OrbitShellProfilesAndLorentzSignature.md` so Monster-labeled anomaly
  reports are described conservatively:
  non-separation plus, at most, a non-unique rigid substructure unless control
  comparisons show otherwise.
- updated `TODO.md` to require baseline/control comparisons before rigid-slot
  anomaly summaries are promoted into repo-facing moonshine-adjacent claims.
- added a second documentation pass from the same `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`
  thread content to record the stronger measurement split:
  JMD-side regime metadata is for structural occupancy/classification, while
  DASHI-side delta/cone/Fejér traces are for dynamics.
- updated `README.md`, `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`, and `TODO.md`
  to treat the current DA51 / exponent-vector embedding as a
  representation-level structural probe, not a reliable Monster-specific
  semantic discriminator, and to queue regime-occupancy then delta-regime
  validation as the next tests.
- added `scripts/regime_test.py` as a local CSV-driven harness for the next
  two anomaly-analysis passes:
  `occupancy` mode compares matched JMD regime distributions and numeric
  summaries between two labeled groups, while `transitions` mode compares
  DASHI-side regime-transition tables.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py` with a `cone` mode for stepwise DASHI-side
  trace analysis:
  it embeds per-step rows, computes deltas, checks a hard non-increasing cone
  on selected axes, and reports Fejér-style weighted energy drift plus
  violation breakdowns.
- added a `dashifine-closure-embedding` preset plus single-group support to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`, so existing sibling-repo files such as
  `../dashifine/hepdata_lyapunov_test_out/dashi_idk_out.csv/closure_embedding_per_step.csv`
  can be analyzed directly.
- first direct preset run on that `dashifine` file reports:
  `cone_pass_rate=0.9333`, `fejer_pass_rate=0.8500`, with the visible
  violations concentrated on `phistar_50_76` through the `v_arrow` axis.
- rewrote `scripts/regime_test.py cone` to learn the structural cone
  separately from the arrow guard:
  it now derives admissible ternary structural signatures from observed deltas,
  reports `structural_cone_pass_rate`, `arrow_pass_rate`, and
  `joint_pass_rate`, and surfaces the nearest admissible structural signature
  for each violation.
- updated the direct `dashifine` preset run after that rewrite:
  `structural_cone_pass_rate=1.0`,
  `arrow_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  `joint_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  confirming that the residual failures are localized arrow-axis breaks rather
  than structural-cone failure.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` again with ultrametric/ternary
  boundary reporting:
  it now prints structural magnitude buckets, an ultrametric-style radius
  histogram, and a focused boundary report for non-joint-admissible steps.
- direct rerun on the same `dashifine` trace confirms the
  `phistar_50_76` failures keep an admissible structural signature with zero
  nearest-signature distance; they are arrow-only boundary cases, not escapes
  from the learned structural cone.
- added an arrow-guard sweep to `scripts/regime_test.py cone` and ran it on the
  same `dashifine` preset:
  the remaining `phistar_50_76` boundary steps clear at minimum tolerances of
  roughly `4e-5`, `8e-4`, `8e-3`, and `8e-2`, giving a concrete bracket for
  any future canonical arrow guard.
- added an explicit boundary/interior class layer plus CSV export to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace this yields `56` `interior` steps and `4`
  `arrow_boundary` steps, with the exported boundary table isolating the
  `phistar_50_76` cases cleanly.
- added canonical arrow profiles to `scripts/regime_test.py cone`
  (`strict`, `boundary`, `lenient`) plus a stable artifact write path for the
  current boundary witness table at
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_latest.csv`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace those profiles currently yield
  `56/4`, `59/1`, and `60/0` for `interior/arrow_boundary`.
- added `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` as a first-pass local JMD-table
  extractor and generated
  `artifacts/regime_test/jmd_regime_table.csv` from the current Agda tree.
- identified the sibling repo `../kant-zk-pastebin` as the explicit DASL-side
  source anchor for the execution bridge and recorded that source-model role in
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` with a first-pass DASL source-model
  loader that parses `../kant-zk-pastebin/src/dasl.rs` and
  `../kant-zk-pastebin/src/sheaf.rs`, emits
  `artifacts/regime_test/dasl_source_lattice_latest.json`, and adds
  DASL-backed `dasl_eigenspace`, `basin_support`, `basin_js`, and `basin_ok`
  fields to the execution/eigen artifacts.
- tightened the semantics of that new source predicate:
  the artifacts now also export `source_support_ok` and
  `source_support_mode=parsed_dasl_eigenspace_prior`, while `basin_ok` is kept
  only as the bridge-facing compatibility alias for the same first-pass
  support-under-prior predicate.
- replaced the old trace-side `Hub` heuristic with a refined classifier that
  treats the mixed structural signature `(1,-1,1)` as `Spoke` rather than
  `Hub`, and now exports both `legacy_trace_eigenspace` and refined
  `trace_eigenspace` in the execution/eigen artifacts.
- direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family shows
  `legacy_vs_refined_trace_agreement=4/5`;
  the only changed family is `pTll_76_106`, which moves from legacy `Hub` to
  refined `Spoke`.
- immediate source-support consequence of that refined labeler:
  the previous `12/60` unsupported block disappears, and the current
  strict-profile source-support proxy now clears all `60/60` checked steps.
- updated the generated Agda witness export so `basinOK` now reflects the
  source-backed `basin_ok` predicate instead of reusing `structural_ok`.
- current direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family with the refined
  labeler keeps the existing step-class split
  (`56` `Interior`, `4` `ArrowBoundary`) while removing the earlier localized
  source-support miss.
- promoted the DASL source loader from the small encoding subset to the full
  `15`-prime Monster catalog already present in `../kant-zk-pastebin`,
  so the default source mode is now `monster-primes` and the emitted source
  JSON records the richer eigenspace distribution
  `Earth=0.4667`, `Spoke=0.4`, `Hub=0.0667`, `Clock=0.0667`.
- direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family under that richer source
  catalog remains stable:
  `56` `Interior`, `4` `ArrowBoundary`, `60/60` `source_support_ok`.
- added an explicit source-projection surface on top of the richer
  `monster-primes` catalog:
  a canonical class-to-prime proxy that matches refined trace eigenspace and
  then selects the highest-exponent source prime in that class.
- current direct projections on the checked five-trace family are:
  Earth-family traces → `p2 / T_2 / exponent 46`,
  refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` → `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`.
- added a scored source-prime ranking surface on top of the canonical
  projection proxy and exported the top-ranked shortlist in the runtime
  artifacts.
- current ranked result on the checked five-trace family:
  Earth-family traces still rank `p2` first,
  while refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` now yields the first meaningful
  split between the conservative canonical and scored views:
  canonical projection stays `p17`, but the scored shortlist ranks
  `p59`, `p71`, then `p17`.
- added an explicit primary source-projection mode to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` so the runtime artifacts now export both the
  repo-default canonical projection surface and a selectable
  `primary_source_projection_*` surface driven by
  `--source-projection-primary canonical|scored`.
- added an explicit `projection_conflict` marker so rows where the canonical
  and primary-selected source representatives diverge are surfaced directly in
  the runtime artifacts without changing the canonical bridge behavior.
- retuned the scored source-prime ranking so it is now anchored to canonical
  consistency in addition to class support, exponent, and attack-triple cues,
  and labeled the exported top-k list explicitly as a diagnostic shortlist.
- exported score-component breakdowns for the ranked and primary source
  projections so the current source-side heuristic can be inspected and tuned
  explicitly in later passes.
- extended the within-class source score with `Hecke` proximity and a weak
  `Bott` cycle prior on top of trace support, exponent, canonical alignment,
  and attack-triple bonus.
- ran the same bridge across the three currently compatible `dashifine` trace
  batches and recorded the summary in
  `artifacts/regime_test/dashifine_trace_batch_latest.json`.
  Source support stayed fully intact and the refined `Spoke` family remained
  canonically `p17`; the only new movement was execution-side, where the larger
  batches added `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` to the
  arrow-boundary family list.
- added a per-family arrow-boundary summary surface to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` and a default artifact at
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_family_latest.json`.
  Current larger-batch read:
  `phistar_50_76` is a small arrow-only tolerance ladder,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` is a single moderate arrow break,
  and `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is the strongest current outlier because it couples
  large arrow violations with `v_dnorm` failures.
- added focused family drilldown/export for `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  Current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` read is now explicit:
  first boundary at `t=10->11`,
  late arrow sign flip,
  mixed `v_arrow`/`v_dnorm` onset,
  no immediate structural-signature change on the first failing step.
- extended that focused drilldown with terminal-step autopsy data:
  per-step raw axis values, next-step axis values, per-axis deltas, and
  alternate `v_dnorm` normalizations
  (`raw`, `log_abs`, `robust_z`, `winsor95`, `family_minmax`).
  On the current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` run, the two terminal `v_dnorm`
  reversals stay positive under all tested transforms, but only at near-zero
  scale (`~9.4e-13`, `~1.6e-13`), tightening the read toward
  terminal-bin/tail-edge stiffness rather than broad cone failure.
- extended the same focused export with raw observable context from the local
  `dashifine` assets.
  The current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` export now records that the observable is a
  `7`-bin spectrum, its last bin (`x≈1350`) has the largest fractional
  uncertainty (`~8.19%`), and the first boundary onset occurs at the late
  `alpha=1e4 -> 1e5` jump.
- extended that focused export again with sibling-repo witness summaries.
  The current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` export now records that the family still
  has `closestpoint_frac=1.0` and `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, while the explicit
  local exception is confined to the MDL-exact descent surface
  (`MDL_monotone=False`, `2` violations, worst increase `0.694577`).
- promoted the `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` family summary from the generic
  `mixed_hard_axis_outlier` bucket to a narrower `mdl_tail_boundary` class
  when the local context shows:
  tail-bin maximum fractional uncertainty,
  closest-point admissibility,
  Fejér-set admissibility,
  and an MDL-exact-only failure surface.
  This leaves the step-level witness unchanged as `ArrowBoundary` while making
  the family-level interpretation more specific.
- the first seeded JMD table rebuild in this pass produced `844` rows total
  with `7` Monster rows and `6` matched control rows.
- extended `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` to merge a repo-tracked seed
  table (`data/regime_test/jmd_regime_seed.csv`) and emit per-field semantic
  provenance columns.
- fixed `scripts/regime_test.py occupancy` so permutation tests and
  leave-one-out classification operate only on the compared `M/O` subset
  rather than leaking unlabeled rows into the statistics.
- current seeded JMD occupancy read on the matched rows is now non-empty:
  `eigenspace JS=0.5569`,
  `bott JS=0.0608`,
  `joint(eigenspace,bott,hecke) JS=0.6176`,
  with leave-one-out naive Bayes at `0.5385` on the actual matched subset.
- added a new parallel Agda bridge surface:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness`,
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityShiftWitness`,
  and a generated concrete current-trace witness module
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness`.
- threaded that new witness through `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`,
  `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, and `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure` without
  changing `DynamicalClosureWitness`.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` with execution-admissibility and
  eigen-overlap exports:
  `artifacts/regime_test/execution_admissibility_latest.json`,
  `artifacts/regime_test/eigen_overlap_latest.csv`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness.agda`.
- direct strict-profile export still confirms the checked `dashifine` trace is
  `56` `Interior` plus `4` `ArrowBoundary`, with no structural-boundary or
  outside-class steps.
- documented that harness in `README.md` and `TODO.md`, keeping the next
  validation order explicit:
  JMD regime occupancy/divergence first, DASHI delta-regime comparisons second.

## 2026-03-20

- clarified repo-facing status docs (`README.md`, `status.md`) that
  `DASHI/Unifier.agda` is an axiomatized sketch module and not part of the
  canonical Stage C closure pipeline.
- removed misleading “assumed proven” labels in `DASHI/Unifier.agda` section
  headings (Lorentz interval, orthogonal split, wave/CCR/UV-finiteness), so the
  file reads as a placeholder interface rather than a proof-status claim.

## 2026-03-14

- changed both closure-hygiene entrypoints
  (`scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py` and
  `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh`) to skip learned `heavy` and `aggregator`
  tasks by default.
- added explicit `--include-heavy` support for aggregate integration runs, so
  routine hygiene passes stop after the relevant child modules instead of
  draining multi-hour summary targets.
- kept `--exclude-heavy` as the explicit skip flag for compatibility, but it is
  now the default behavior.

## 2026-03-12

- synchronized repo status docs with current canonical implementation:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, and `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` now explicitly include the
  implemented
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`
  segment on the canonical closure route.
- closed stale TODO entries for already-landed canonical wave-lift work in
  `TODO.md` (`Quadratic⇒Clifford` exclusivity upstream, grading/even interface,
  canonical wave-lift construction, witness-form factorization,
  canonical bundle threading).
- revalidated targeted bridge modules during the docs/TODO sync:
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
- implemented the missing `Quadratic ⇒ Signature` bridge shape in
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`:
  - added explicit theorem `quadraticConeIsotropyForces31` with inputs
    `(Quadratic, Cone, ConeMetricCompat, iso, fs, arrow)` and output
    `SignatureLaw`,
  - routed it through the two-step classification structure
    (`eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` then
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31`),
  - added `normalizedCoreClassifies31` to thread the
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` normalization seam
    into the classification path,
  - kept `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms` as the canonical
    `Signature31Theorem` constructor consumed by Stage-C bridges.
- tightened that bridge into a theorem lock package:
  - added `LorentzSignatureLock` to separate
    `(3,1)` witness,
    uniqueness of admissible signature,
    and non-admissibility of rival signatures,
  - added `lorentzSignatureLockFromCausalAxioms` as the
    `quadratic+cone+isotropy+arrow+finite-speed` lock constructor,
  - exported `lorentzLockFromIntrinsic` / `lorentzLock` wrappers through the
    intrinsic and shift headline signature modules.
- wired theorem-bearing signature fields through closure records:
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.signature31Theorem`,
  - `PhysicsClosureFull.signature31Theorem`,
  both populated from `S31OP.signature31-theorem`.
- completed a theorem-dependency audit of the quadratic=>signature path and
  removed the remaining hidden profile prerequisite from intrinsic theorem
  construction:
  - split
    `DASHI/Geometry/Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing.agda` into
    `IntrinsicSignatureCoreAxioms` (theorem-primary inputs) and
    `IntrinsicProfileWitness` (secondary witness inputs),
  - made `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` and `signature31FromIntrinsic`
    depend only on core axioms,
  - kept profile equality and profile-driven law extraction available only as
    secondary certification surfaces.
- rewired
  `DASHI/Physics/Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance.agda` to construct
  `shiftIntrinsicCoreAxioms` and `shiftProfileWitness` separately, preserving
  exports while preventing profile data from being a constructor-time
  dependency of the primary theorem.
- clarified `DASHI/Physics/Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile.agda` comments to
  state explicitly that the primary theorem export does not depend on profile
  equality input.
- finished the projection/defect split cleanup in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now derives
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` locally instead of importing those fields
  from `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- validated the canonical contraction path after cleanup with targeted checks:
  `ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- strengthened `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` so
  `WaveLift⇒Even` is theorem-shaped: added `CliffordGrading`,
  structural `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical `WaveLift` packaging, and explicit
  factorization witnesses
  `Σ e ∈ Even, waveLift s ≡ incl e` in `WaveLiftIntoEven`.
- rewired `DASHI/Physics/ConcreteClosureStack.agda` to inhabit the stronger
  canonical bridge fields by construction:
  `q2cl` now exports `mul`/`pairedWord`, and `wl` now builds
  grading + even-subalgebra + wave-lift + factorization witnesses from the
  same canonical Clifford object.
- added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda` as the
  dedicated canonical export module for
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- updated `README.md`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `TODO.md`,
  and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to lock the downstream-only
  `Quadratic⇒Clifford` dependency for `WaveLift⇒Even`.

- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` as a
  canonical closure bridge from strengthened contraction output to a Clifford
  presentation package, including:
  - normalized quadratic witness export from
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`,
  - canonical bilinear-form builder from normalized quadratic data,
  - theorem-level `Quadratic⇒Clifford` build surface,
  - explicit universal-property seam field.
- rewired `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` to export the new
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge fields.
- upgraded the universal seam in
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` from a raw placeholder to an explicit
  factorization interface (`TargetCarrier`, `factor`,
  generator-compatibility law).
- completed quadratic=>signature theorem-source hardening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda` as the canonical
    causal-classification choke point for normalized quadratics,
  - threading
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` into that module
    as the explicit normalization seam for `Q̂core`,
  - splitting the signature classification internals into
    `eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` (Lemma A) and
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31` (Lemma B),
  - rewiring `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` so
    `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` is theorem-primary through
    `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms`,
  - retaining profile equality as secondary certification via
    `profileSignatureLawFromIntrinsic`,
  - preserving `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` surface
    unchanged (`S31OP.signature31-theorem`, `S31OP.signature31`).
- completed contraction=>quadratic canonical tightening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda` as
    the explicit split/parallelogram bridge module,
  - routing `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` through that module’s canonical
    projection-defect package,
  - expanding `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields,
    while preserving
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` and
    `normalizedQuadratic` consumer behavior unchanged.
- completed the pending cross-realization snap-threshold extension by:
  - adding `Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness` as a Bool inversion-specific
    witness module on the shared closure carrier,
  - rewiring `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` to that witness,
  - adding `SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4` as a standalone `B₄` harness,
  - exporting `snapThresholdB4Verdict` through
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`,
  - wiring the new harness module into `DASHI/Everything`.
- added a Base369 normalization-hardening track in docs (`README.md`,
  `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`) to keep
  proof-soundness constraints explicit while reducing typecheck costs.
- updated `TODO.md` with explicit Base369 closed-form migration tasks and an
  `abstract`-barrier follow-up scoped to theorem-only consumers.
- added closed-form cyclic companions in `Base369.agda`:
  `fromTriIndex`, `fromHexIndex`, `fromNonaryIndex`,
  `triXor-closed`, `hexXor-closed`, `nonaryXor-closed`.
- added `triXor-spin-correct` to bridge the recursive triadic reference
  implementation back to the canonical closed-form `triXor`.
- added `hexXor-closed-correct` and `nonaryXor-closed-correct` so all Base369
  closed-form cyclic companions now have explicit correctness bridges to the
  existing recursive `spin` operators.
- switched canonical Base369 exports (`triXor`, `hexXor`, `nonaryXor`) to the
  closed-form definitions and kept recursive reference implementations as
  `triXor-spin`, `hexXor-spin`, and `nonaryXor-spin`.
- added a first conservative `abstract` rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`: theorem-bundle and moonshine-summary
  aliases now route through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving the
  existing exported names.
- extended the conservative `abstract` rollout to aggregate bundle values in
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` by routing
  each canonical bundle through an opaque `*-abs` wrapper while preserving
  exported names.
- continued the `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` rollout with a first regime
  alias batch (`RegimeSummary` through `RegimeRobustnessSummary`) routed
  through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving exported names.
- completed the remaining moonshine/regime alias rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` (`RegimeIntegrity` through
  `RegimeResilience`) using the same opaque `*-abs` wrapper pattern while
  preserving exported names.
- hardened `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` by replacing the
  fragile type-level seam equality (`Set`-valued alias + equality law) with a
  direct value-level seam witness, removing the `Set` vs `⊤` mismatch path.
- introduced a named seam record in
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`:
  `UniqueUpToScaleSeam`, and moved the contraction-uniqueness witness into
  `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`; kept compatibility via
  top-level accessor `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- simplified `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` seam typing so
  `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` is non-parameterized and set-level, while
  canonical quadratic normalization evidence remains in `normalizedQuadratic`.
- added `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` as the authoritative Stage C claim chain and
  introduced explicit module labels (`canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`) plus promotion/change-control rules.
- implemented the first concrete label registry in `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`
  for current closure-relevant modules and added an explicit canonical-first
  repo-facing citation order.
- wired closure-pipeline governance into repo metadata:
  added a README pointer, added canonical-label policy + enforcement tasks to
  `TODO.md`, and added pipeline governance/enforcement priorities to `plan.md`.
- validated the implementation with a targeted typecheck:
  `agda Base369.agda`.
- validated the new bundle-level wrappers with targeted typechecks:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after the first regime-alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after completing the remaining regime
  alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- validated the bridge-seam patch with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  and re-ran both bundle checks above.
- validated the seam-record refactor with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`,
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`,
  and `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda`.
- attempted targeted validation of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`; blocked by an
  existing upstream type error in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  (`Set !=< ⊤` around `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`), outside this scoped change.

## 2026-03-10

- replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness
  with `SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus` (proxy policy) and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import tree to use the synthetic one-minus
  realization label.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (reusing the shift
  snap witness pending a Bool inversion-specific witness).
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report that bundles
  mirror-signature exclusion with competing 4D profile failures, and wired the
  shift instance verdict into the validation summary and top-level imports.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third case and exposed a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict in the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by using a
  non-open wave-regime recovery import and keeping explicit aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite in the docs/TODO.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift validation placeholder.

## 2026-03-09

- aligned repo docs/TODO/context with the stronger archive-backed
  `Math Prof Outreach Stage` crosswalk:
  - wave / psi / graded-series bridge now described as strongly scaffolded
  - gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction now described as
    substantially scaffolded
  - quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program now described as a
    clearer candidate route
  - open physics gaps kept explicit:
    natural dynamics law,
    conserved physical quantity,
    explicit continuum limit,
    realization-independent proof,
    full gauge/matter recovery as theorem

- consolidation turn landed:
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Algebra/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung wave-regime theorem imports
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Consumers/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung recovery/consumer imports
  - kept per-rung theorem and consumer modules in place as compatibility
    surfaces; no theorem content changed in this pass

- promoted the math-prof outreach material into first-class repo docs under
  `Docs/`, including:
  a short outreach summary,
  a claim/evidence crosswalk,
  and a ranked archive-thread note tied to the canonical archived thread
  metadata.
- corrected the outreach evidence policy so canonical Agda module paths and
  repo-facing summary surfaces are now the primary citations, with
  `all_code44.txt` treated only as corroborating index evidence.
- upgraded the orbit-shell generating-series wording across the docs from
  “next object to add” to “already landed local formal object”, while keeping
  the modular / graded-trace interpretation explicitly open.
- aligned the compactified context and TODO with the same
  theorem-backed vs scaffold-present vs still-open boundary used by the new
  outreach docs.

## 2026-03-08

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime transparency rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- restored `DASHI.Geometry.ClosestPoint` as a geometry-side compatibility wrapper over `DASHI.Energy.ClosestPoint` so the top-level import tree compiles cleanly again.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime continuity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

  recovery widening above the current recovered-wave-regime slice,

  ladder now has a wave-observable-facing downstream consumer,

- threaded those new slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, `PhysicsClosureSummary`, and
  `Everything.agda`,
- clarified the safe symmetry-interpretation order for the orbit-shell story:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  Niemeier/umbral-style only after a genuine root-lattice shell realization,
  and Monster/Moonshine only after a graded-module / trace bridge,
- added a compactified context note capturing that archived-thread decision so
  the repo-facing wording does not drift away from the canonical context,
- added a standing context-fetch note:
  when docs feel light, check the local chat archive first via
  `robust-context-fetch`, ask the user for likely online chat IDs/titles if
  needed, and always record title/IDs/source/main topics for referenced chats,
- documented Stage C as the open "minimal credible physics closure" target
  rather than a vague full-closure slogan,
- added `CanonicalGaugeConstraintBridgeTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  tying the concrete closure theorem and the gauge-contract theorem together on
  the same concrete constraint carrier,
- added `KnownLimitsPropagationSpinTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  widening the local known-limits story from local recovery/effective geometry
  to a propagation-bearing spin theorem slice,
- added `CanonicalConstraintGaugePackage` and
  `ParametricGaugeConstraintTheorem`, making the current gauge/constraint
  widening abstract over carrier while keeping the current concrete carrier as
  the first realized instance,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveryPackage` and
  `KnownLimitsCausalPropagationTheorem`, widening the current known-limits
  story beyond the local propagation/spin bridge into a local causal/effective
  propagation theorem slice,
- rewired `SpinLocalLorentzBridgeTheorem` to depend on the stronger local
  causal-propagation theorem rather than directly on the older local/effective
  geometry pair,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicClosureTheorem` as a stronger algebraic widening
  over the current canonical gauge-package layer,
- added `KnownLimitsExtendedLocalRecoveryTheorem` and a
  propagation-facing canonical consumer so the local physics runway no longer
  stops at the current coherence slice,

  widening above the current package-parametric bridge,

  widening above the current algebraic-bundle/stability layer,

  above the current complete-local-regime layer,

  has a geometry-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin and
  propagation consumers,
- added `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle` as a richer prototype-only bundle
  over the existing detailed twined report and wave summary,
- threaded those widened theorem slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and `PhysicsClosureSummary`,
- added richer moonshine-side summary surfaces:
  `WaveGradedShellPrototypeSummary` and `TwinedComparisonSummary`,
  keeping the track explicitly finite, graded/twined, and prototype-only,
- added a dedicated design note for the minimum acceptable physics-closure
  boundary,
- reorganized `TODO.md` into theorem/dynamics, observable/prediction, shared
  integration, and deferred sections,
- introduced closure-side dynamics and observable/prediction packaging in code,
- rewired the main full-closure instances toward the intrinsic signature path
  and real shift dynamics witnesses.
- clarified the observable boundary so it now separates:
  proved outputs,
  excluded alternatives,
  and separately documented forward prediction claims.
- expanded the typed observable package with the proved current shell/orientation
  outputs and the exclusion of the non-`(3,1)` 4D candidates.
- added a repo-facing forward-prediction table with confidence levels and
  falsifiers for the current leading novel claims.
- marked profile rigidity as the flagship next-phase benchmark in the roadmap,
  minimum-closure note, README, and TODO.
- added a typed realization-profile-rigidity validation surface with benchmark
  verdicts, a shift reference report, and a tail-permutation alternate slot.
- tightened the Stage C closure boundary by exposing the minimum-credible
  adapter and authoritative dynamics/Lyapunov accessors for downstream
  consumers.
- upgraded the tail-permutation benchmark slot into a real comparison
  observation with computed shell-1 and shell-2 profiles.
- classified tail permutations as a negative control rather than an admissible
  alternate realization, and wired the first nontrivial rigidity report
  through the typed harness.
- added a concrete `P0/P1/P2` milestone document for physics closure work.
- formalized the admissible comparison realization interface so future
  profile-rigidity candidates must expose the full
  orientation/profile/signature surface.
- added an aggregate rigidity-suite report that groups:
  self exact match,
  Bool inversion admissible result,
  and tail-permutation negative control.
- implemented the first admissible alternate realization:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask, with shell-1 and
  shell-2 profile computation.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  same signature class with non-rigid shell profiles.
- refactored the intrinsic shell/orbit theorem boundary so theorem-critical
  records no longer mention finite realization fields; finite enumeration now
  remains on the shift-instance discharge side.
- added a closure-facing validation adapter so the minimum-credible Stage C
  entrypoint can expose the aggregate rigidity suite and its explicit verdicts.
- added the first admissible alternate realization implementation:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  signature agrees while profile rigidity fails.
- added a repo-facing closure validation summary surface that re-exports the
  current Stage C rigidity verdicts from the minimum-credible validation
  adapter,
- recorded the current validation snapshot explicitly in the docs and README:
  signed-permutation self-check `exactMatch`,
  Bool inversion admissible case `signatureOnlyMatch`,
  tail-permutation negative control `mismatch`.
- started the Fejér-over-χ² benchmark as a typed shift reference harness with
  theorem-backed Fejér / closest-point / MDL witnesses,
- made the χ² side explicit as a falsifier-status boundary instead of
  overstating it as a completed Agda proof.
- upgraded the χ² benchmark status from flat `pending` to an intermediate
  `interfaceWired` state when the snap / `chi2Spike` boundary is present,
- exposed the Fejér benchmark snapshot through the repo-facing closure
  validation summary:
  positive side established,
  χ² side interface-wired,
  standalone falsifier still not formalized.
- tightened the Fejér benchmark report so the positive side now carries the
  actual shift seam and MDL/Fejér witnesses directly instead of placeholder
  booleans.
- documented the Coxeter / Weyl-group direction as the preferred next
  mathematically serious alternate realization after Bool inversion,
- replaced the vocabulary-only `B₄` scaffold with an independent
  root-shell/Weyl-action shell-orbit computation,
- added a standalone `B₄` shell comparison report and exposed it through the
  validation summary without promoting it into the admissible rigidity harness,
- kept orientation/signature promotion for the `B₄` realization explicitly
  deferred until it is justified.
- added a repo-facing note documenting the orbit-shell / Lorentz-signature
  framing and the current validation ladder,
- added a typed `B₄` promotion status surface so the summary can say
  `standaloneOnly` explicitly instead of relying on prose alone.
- refined the standalone `B₄` comparison report so it now classifies the
  computed shell data by candidate shell neighborhood; the current `B₄`
  realization lands in the definite shell class `[8] / [24]`, clarifying that
  Lorentz-harness promotion is blocked structurally rather than by missing
  wiring alone.
- added a finite orbit-shell generating series layer built from orientation
  plus shell-1 / shell-2 orbit-size multiplicities.
- added theorem-backed shift-series and standalone `B₄` series modules, then
  exposed a standalone `B₄` series comparison through the closure-validation
  summary.
- added a concrete grade-0 wave-series prototype from the shift series while
  keeping it outside the theorem-critical closure path and any moonshine-level
  claim surface.
- promoted shell-neighborhood class to a first-class API shared by the shift
  reference and the standalone `B₄` comparison surface.
- added a bounded one-minus shell-family module proving the current shell-1
  family pattern for `m = 2..8`.
- refactored the standalone `B₄` report to use the canonical neighborhood type
  instead of a `B₄`-specific enum.
- updated the roadmap and TODOs so the next theorem milestone after the bounded
  family is an explicit parametric-`m` generalization.
- generalized the shell-neighborhood classifier so the one-minus family is
  recognized structurally from shell-1 triples rather than only by the bounded
  lookup cases.
- added a parametric `m` one-minus family layer that exposes the general family
  formula and its shell-neighborhood classification, while keeping the bounded
  `m = 2..8` module as the theorem-backed witness layer.
- exposed the parametric family layer through the closure validation/summary
  surface for the current shift reference.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` so it now reuses the same concrete
  constraint system, Lie structure, and closure witness as the canonical full
  closure instance instead of a trivial compatibility shim.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` in the same way, so the legacy
  assumed closure surface now also reuses the concrete constraint witness
  rather than a trivial closure shim.
- added an explicit canonical Stage C entrypoint and status surface so the
  minimum-credible closure path is authoritative in code, while compatibility
  wrappers and prototype branches remain explicitly non-canonical.
- added a typed observable-collapse benchmark surface for the shift reference,
  backed by the `RealClosureKitFiber` observable fixed-point and uniqueness
  witnesses and ready for repo-facing validation summary export.
- tightened the one-minus shell story from a parametric family layer into a
  real parametric shell-1 theorem exported through the validation summary.
- added a concrete shift-side χ²-boundary witness from the severity/snap
  layer and promoted the Fejér-over-χ² shift reference off the old
  `interfaceWired` status.
- added a standalone typed snap-threshold benchmark for the shift reference
  and exposed it through the repo-facing validation summary.
- expanded the single χ² boundary witness into a small typed shift-side
  boundary library and surfaced its size through the validation summary.
- added an independent synthetic one-minus shell-side realization in the
  Lorentz neighborhood and surfaced its standalone comparison status through
  the validation summary.
- extended the synthetic Lorentz-neighborhood candidate from shell-1-only to a
  profile-aware shell candidate with matching shell-1 and shell-2 data, while
  keeping it outside the admissible harness until orientation/signature are
  justified independently.
- added a prototype-only Lorentz-neighborhood dynamic candidate scaffold so
  the realization search now has an explicit dynamics-side placeholder without
  overstating admissible status.
- added a typed synthetic-promotion bridge so the exact blocker between the
  profile-aware synthetic candidate and admissible-harness promotion is now
  explicit in code: orientation/signature remain independently unjustified.
- strengthened the canonical shift dynamics package with an explicit status
  surface for propagation, causal admissibility, monotone quantity, and
  effective geometry, and threaded that status through the validation/closure
  summary surfaces.
- tightened the synthetic promotion path again by adding an explicit
  orientation/signature bridge from the current synthetic full-profile match;
  the remaining blocker to admissible-harness promotion is now independent
  dynamics.
- replaced the naked theorem-critical placeholder uses on the shift signature
  path with real local witness lemmas for cone nontriviality, cone/Q
  preservation, and finite-action compatibility, while keeping the public
  interface stable.
- promoted the synthetic one-minus candidate into the admissible rigidity
  harness by adding a minimal independent-dynamics witness and a concrete
  admissible realization module.
- switched the canonical admissible Stage C comparison from Bool inversion to
  the synthetic one-minus candidate; Bool inversion remains available as a
  secondary admissible `signatureOnlyMatch` comparison.
- added a typed synthetic dynamics witness module and wired the Lorentz
  neighborhood dynamic candidate through it instead of relying only on a
  descriptive scaffold record.
- added a semantics-bearing canonical dynamics witness companion, plus
  canonical constraint-closure and known-limits status surfaces, and exposed
  them through the canonical Stage C / validation summary path.
- re-exported the first scoped known-limits recovery witness and the
  witness-bearing canonical spin/Dirac consumer directly from Canonical
  Stage C, so downstream users can stay on the authoritative closure
  entrypoint instead of reconstructing those runway surfaces manually.
- added a concrete minimal canonical constraint-closure witness and a stronger
  known-limits recovery witness carrying actual propagation/effective-geometry
  data, then exposed both through the canonical Stage C / validation summary
  path.
- added a minimal algebraic-closure theorem on top of the canonical concrete
  constraint witness, and a scoped known-limits local-recovery theorem on top
  of the stronger propagation/effective-geometry recovery witness.
- added a scoped effective-geometry theorem on top of the local known-limits
  recovery theorem, so the canonical path now carries a first theorem-bearing
  local geometry slice instead of only status/witness surfaces.
- documented the next scoped runway theorem order explicitly:
  gauge-contract theorem first, then spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem.
- added a scoped canonical gauge-contract theorem on top of the concrete
  closure baseline, and a scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem on top of
  the local recovery/effective-geometry baseline.
- added finite graded orbit-shell series for the shift signed action and the
  standalone `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite shell actions for the shift signed action and the standalone
  `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite twined shell traces via fixed-point counts for both shift and
  `B₄`, including identity and non-identity examples.
- added a wave-graded shell-module/trace adapter as a prototype-only grading
  bridge, explicitly outside the canonical Stage C closure path.
- updated docs and summary surfaces to classify this as pre-moonshine
  Weyl/theta-like infrastructure rather than a modularity, umbral, or Monster
  claim.
- added a second realized carrier instance for the carrier-parametric
  gauge/constraint theorem.
- added a local geometry-transport theorem above the current local
  causal-effective propagation slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge
  to sit downstream of it.
- added a canonical Stage C theorem bundle aggregating the current runway
  theorem ladder.
- added richer finite twiner libraries for shift and `B₄`, plus a first
  graded/twined comparison report surface for the pre-moonshine track.
- added a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem layer on top of
  the existing carrier-parametric gauge theorem, plus a realized-instances
  report covering the current primary and secondary carriers.
- added a local causal-geometry coherence theorem above the current
  geometry-transport slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge to sit
  downstream of that stronger local theorem.
- added a canonical Stage C summary bundle as a read-only aggregation surface
  over the authoritative theorem/validation ladder.
- widened the pre-moonshine comparison layer with additional labeled twiner
  cases for shift and `B₄`, plus a richer detailed graded/twined comparison
  report.
- exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry coherence slice through the
  canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime coherence slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.

- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime balance rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime symmetry rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- cleanup pass:
  - simplified `PhysicsClosureSummary` export behavior to stop the stale warning
    flood from the giant selective `using` surface
  - added short-path ladder/wrapper modules for the closure and moonshine
    wave-regime hotspots
  - rewired `Everything.agda` to cover the new ladder modules while preserving
    compatibility with the old long module names
- Restored the legacy `MDL.Core.Core` import path as a compatibility wrapper so the widened closure/dynamics ladder continues to compile against older module references.
- Restored the legacy `Monster.TraceCounts` import path as a compatibility wrapper so the top-level legacy Monster path continues to compile.
- Added the short-path `Clarity` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on both the algebra and known-limits ladders, plus its canonical consumer and moonshine summary surface.
- Added the short-path `Refinement` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on both the algebra and known-limits ladders, plus its canonical consumer and moonshine summary surface.

- Added the short-path `Legibility` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on both the algebra and known-limits ladders, plus its canonical consumer and moonshine summary surface.

- Tightened `Closure/Canonical/Ladder` so it no longer publicly re-exports both grouped wave-regime ladders and `CanonicalStageC`, eliminating the duplicate-export collision on the cleaned canonical summary path.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda` as the grouped local-program entrypoint.
- Updated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda` to use the local-program bundle and grouped ladder surfaces rather than mirroring `CanonicalStageC` directly.
- Marked the current turn as a cleanup/consolidation pass in the repo docs/TODO/context; no new theorem rungs added in this pass.
- Rewired `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` to grouped wave-regime imports with internal compatibility aliases, eliminating the last direct per-rung dependency on the validation summary path.
- Verified the grouped-import migration by typechecking `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and top-level `Everything.agda`.
- Added the `Traceability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Auditability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.

- Added the `Interoperability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Composability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Maintainability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Extensibility` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Scalability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, and moonshine summary.
- Added the `Durability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, and moonshine summary.
- Added the `Usability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Operability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Fixed canonical Stage C alias collisions between `Compatibility` and `Composability` on the algebra, recovery, and consumer ladders; `CanonicalStageC.agda` now uses distinct aliases and the grouped summary path compiles cleanly again.
- Added `Sustainability` wave-regime rung across algebra, recovery, canonical consumer, and moonshine summary grouped surfaces.
- Re-focused on the actual Stage C bottleneck instead of adding more local rungs: `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries an explicit `ProjectionDefectQuadraticWitness` and a named `QuadraticUniquenessBridge`, and `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` now exposes a named `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` instead of a raw pending placeholder.
- 2026-03-11: added `Stewardship` theorem/consumer/summary rung to the grouped wave-regime ladder and re-exported it through the grouped closure/moonshine surfaces.
- 2026-03-11: added `Accountability` theorem/consumer/summary rung to the grouped wave-regime ladder and re-exported it through the grouped closure/moonshine surfaces.
- 2026-03-29: landed the ultrametric formal shell (PhysicalTheory/Refinement/SymmetryQuotient/Observable/QuantumHistory/Measurement/ClassicalEmergence/Benchmark/CandidateFieldTheory/PhysicalTheoryShell) and rewired the scalar continuum toy to use a left-boundary-pinned local gating relaxation instead of a vacuum jump, with refinement- and observable-stability proofs preserved.
- 2026-03-29: threaded the RG universality toy through the same shell with a relevant/irrelevant state split, exact refinement on the irrelevant sector, quotient-trivial observables (`relevantObs`, `irrelevantDefectObs`), and recovery lemmas derived from the scalar contraction.
- 2026-03-29: added `DASHI/Physics/LocalWitness.agda` so toys can carry explicit local operator/scaling/observable-invariance witnesses instead of relying on repo-global structures.
- 2026-03-29: upgraded `DASHI/Physics/Toy/ScalarContinuum.agda` again from the one-sided gate to a more symmetric centered local relaxation, added a nontrivial global sign-flip action and support-quotient, and switched the refinement tower to an intentionally coarse approximate witness while keeping recovery/typecheck intact.
- 2026-03-29: upgraded `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` from the earlier quotient-trivial shell to a sign-flip quotient on the irrelevant sector plus local operator/scaling/observable witnesses.
- 2026-03-29: added `DASHI/Physics/Toy/GaugeShell.agda`, a shell-level gauge toy where gauge origin is quotiented away from field content, with defect descent, refinement, observable, and recovery lemmas.
# 2026-03-29

- add `DASHI/Physics/CLOCKPhaseBridge.agda`, packaging the safe cyclic CLOCK/DASHI bridge on top of the repo’s existing `HexTruth`/`TriTruth` carriers together with cone, contraction, and MDL witnesses
- prove the coarse phase law against the real `Base369` definitions:
  `coarseHex (rotateHex h) ≡ rotateTri (coarseHex h)`,
  and lift the thread’s schema to states via a `phase-step²` witness yielding
  `coarse (phase (T² x)) ≡ rotateTri (coarse (phase x))`
- add `DASHI/Physics/CLOCKPhaseInstance.agda`, instantiating the bridge on a concrete two-phase lagged clock state and proving the `phase-step²` witness on an actual carrier

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Toy/ScalarContinuum.agda` so refinement no longer uses the degenerate `approxEq₀ = ⊤`; it now proves a recursive “all but last coordinate” witness against the centered local relaxation
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with explicit basin-label invariance, irrelevant-size contraction under step/coarse, a relevance/irrelevance scaling theorem, and recovered observable-collapse lemmas

- finish the RG recovered-tail story so canonical basin collapse persists across all later iterates once the recovered regime is reached

- add `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda`, exposing the RG asymptotic witness and recovered-tail/canonical-collapse results through named bundle records
- add `DASHI/Physics/Toy/GaugeSummaryBundle.agda`, exposing a named Gauge asymptotic bundle plus recovered-tail/canonical-collapse bundle
- wire the new CLOCK/RG/Gauge summary bundle modules into `DASHI/Everything.agda`
- add `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`, a single cross-toy consumer module that re-exports the packaged CLOCK/RG/Gauge summary surfaces
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with an explicit renormalization family `rgRenormalize` and `RGRenormalizationBundle`, making the coarse-graining story a named operator package rather than only a flat lemma collection
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` with `RGRenormalizationSummary`
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ToySummaryConsumer.agda`, wiring the unified toy bundle into a closure-side consumer alongside the canonical local-program bundle
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` again with a two-parameter RG flow family `rgFlow k m n = stepPow n m ∘ coarsePow k n`, plus `RGFlowBundle` packaging basin stability, observable monotonicity, and canonical-on-recovered facts
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` with `RGFlowSummary` and expose it through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with schedule-level RG flow comparison theorems (`rgFlow-step-monotone`, `rgFlow-irr-observable-step-monotone`) and recovered-tail schedule theorems (`rgFlow-step-tail-canonical`, `rgFlow-step-tail-canonical-observable`), folding them into `RGFlowBundle`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with a more tightly coupled fused RG operator `rgFused` and `RGFusedBundle`, including basin stability, observable monotonicity, recovered canonical collapse, and the base comparison `rgFused zero = rgFlow zero 1`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` with `RGFusedSummary` and expose it through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` again with fused recovered-tail persistence theorems (`rgFused-step-tail-canonical`, `rgFused-step-tail-canonical-observable`) and fold them into `RGFusedBundle`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with a weak fused-vs-flow comparison pack (`rgFused-flow-basin-agree`, `rgFused-flow-rel-observable-agree`, `rgFused-flow-recovered-same-class`, `rgFused-flow-recovered-observable-agree`), adding operator-aware comparison without relying on raw coarse-depth associativity
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with a safer mixed-schedule comparison layer (`rgFused-stepPow-flow-basin-agree`, `rgFused-stepPow-flow-rel-observable-agree`) that compares `stepPow` after the fused operator against nearby fixed-depth flow schedules without invoking coarse-depth associativity
- add a minimal RG prediction/benchmark layer to `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` (`rgPredictionTheory`, `rgBenchmarkTheory`, `rgBenchmarkMatch`) and expose it through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` and `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with benchmark-facing comparison theorems (`rgFused-flow-rel-benchmark-agree`, `rgFused-stepPow-flow-rel-benchmark-agree`, `rgFlow-irr-benchmark-step-monotone`) and expose them through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` and `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with benchmark datasets and full-score theorems (`rgBenchmarkDataset`, `rgBenchmarkSelfMismatch-zero`, `rgFused-flow-recovered-benchmark-mismatch-zero`) so the current mismatch score is theorem-bearing in the recovered regime
- add a raw-state schedule-sensitive RG benchmark surface (`rgRawQuotiented`, `rgScheduledPredictionTheory`, `rgScheduledBenchmarkTheory`) together with `rgScheduled-rel-benchmark-stable` and `rgScheduled-irr-benchmark-step-monotone`, and expose it through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` and `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`
- add a scale-aware mixed coarse/evolve RG schedule layer (`RGMixedSchedule`, `rgRunMixed`, `rgMixedBenchmarkTheory`, `rgMixedBenchmarkMatch`) with self-mismatch, relevance stability, irrelevance bound, and a uniform-one comparison back to `rgFused`, and expose it through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` and `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda`
- extend the mixed RG benchmark surface with cross-schedule theorems (`rgMixed-rel-benchmark-agree`, `rgMixed-recovered-same-class`, `rgMixed-recovered-observable-agree`, `rgMixed-recovered-benchmark-mismatch-zero`) and expose them through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda`
- extend the mixed RG benchmark surface with tail persistence theorems (`rgMixed-step-tail-canonical`, `rgMixed-step-tail-canonical-observable`) so recovered mixed schedules stay at the same canonical class/observable under later target-scale evolution
- extend the mixed RG benchmark surface with benchmark-tail collapse theorems (`rgMixed-step-tail-benchmark-mismatch-zero`, `rgMixed-step-tail-cross-benchmark-mismatch-zero`) so recovered mixed schedules also have zero benchmark mismatch after further target-scale evolution, both against the canonical vacuum benchmark and against each other
- add a parallel richer RG benchmark score layer (`RGBenchmarkScore`) with four channels (`endpoint`, `path`, `recovery`, `scale`), expose it through `rgRichBenchmarkMatch`, `rgMixedRichBenchmarkMatch`, `RGRichBenchmarkSummary`, and the unified toy bundle, and prove self/recovered zero-score theorems for the new structured score without breaking the earlier thin compatibility score
- add a mixed trace-aware RG benchmark surface (`rgMixedPathMass`, `rgMixedRecoveryMass`, `rgMixedScaleMass`, `rgMixedTraceBenchmarkTheory`, `rgMixedTraceBenchmarkMatch`) and expose it through `RGMixedTraceBenchmarkSummary` and the unified toy bundle; prove self zero-score and recovered endpoint-zero theorems so the benchmark can retain path/recovery/scale structure even after endpoint recovery
- add the first Phase 2 RG hierarchy layer: `RGCoarseScheme`, `RGFlowMode`, and `RGFixedPoint` in `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda`, together with additive scheme/mode operators (`rgCoarseBy`, `rgStepBy`, `coarsePowBy`, `rgSchemeFlow`) and a first theorem pack (`rgSchemeFlow-basin-stable`, `rgSchemeFlow-rel-observable-stable`, `rgSchemeFlow-canonical-on-recovered`, `rgSchemeFlow-fixedPoint-on-recovered`); expose it through `RGPhase2HierarchySummary` and the unified toy bundle
- lift the RG mixed path layer onto the new Phase 2 hierarchy via `RGMixedSchedule2`, `rgRunMixed2`, `uniformMixed2`, and a first benchmark-facing theorem pack (`rgMixed2-basin-stable`, `rgMixed2-irrelevant-bounded`, `rgMixed2-recovered-same-class`, `rgMixed2TraceBenchmarkSelfMismatch-zero`, `rgMixed2TraceRecovered-endpoint-zero`); expose it through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary` and the unified toy bundle
- make the Phase-2 RG mixed trace channels explicitly scheme/mode-sensitive with `rgMixed2PathMass`, `rgMixed2RecoveryMass`, and `rgMixed2ScaleMass`, then land the first true Phase-3 split theorem: `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split` proves one-layer `tailScheme` vs `flipTailScheme` in `holdMode` share the same vacuum endpoint class while still differing on the trace benchmark path channel; export it through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary`
- extend that Phase-3 split from the one-layer witness to arbitrary positive uniform coarse depth in `holdMode` via `rgRunUniformMixed2-hold-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-tail-path-on-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-flip-path-on-vacuum`, and `rgUniformMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split`; expose the deeper witness through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary.uniform-tail-vs-flip-positive-depth-split`
- add the first non-vacuum Phase-3 hold witness: `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-one-layer-hold-endpoint-class` and `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-one-layer-hold-path-step` show that one-layer `holdMode` tail-vs-flip schedules agree on endpoint class for arbitrary states while the raw path channel differs by one; expose it through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary.one-layer-hold-raw-split`
- probe widening the canonical abstract-bundle conserved charge with `heckeSignature`, then back the change out after Agda shows it fails on the concrete `CP` branch under the current closure-derived law
- update `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`, and `TODO.md` to record that `heckeSignature` and `eigenSummary` remain observable-side only for the current law, and that adding more canonical transported phase families is now lower-value than a less canonical target family or a stronger dynamics law
- added [`Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`](./Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md)
  to record the now-archived boundary from `Dashi and Physics Insights`:
  Hecke/FRACTRAN belong first on the prime-lattice representation layer rather
  than as the next default conserved charge in the contractive closure lane.
- strengthened `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` with the
  first principled metadata lift from finite-twined report fields into the
  normalized observable, adding `normalizedObservable` report counts, support,
  and eigen-ratio summary data rather than leaving all richer report structure
  stranded under `traceReport`
- updated `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md` and `TODO.md` to record that this
  first principled lift is now landed and that the next moonshine step is a
  richer normalized-observable lift beyond verdict-slot/cardinality metadata

# 2026-05-05

- extend `scripts/extract_ct18_pdf_packet.py` with a rapidity-window
  Drell-Yan light-quark luminosity diagnostic over the local CT18NLO central
  grid, including mass-window integrations for t43, Z-peak, and t45
- refresh `scripts/data/pdf/ct18_dashi_pdf_packet.json` with the new CT18
  convention probe values: fixed-`x` ratio `1.0506681065158017`,
  rapidity-window center ratio `0.13510406305538247`, and rapidity-window
  mass-window ratio `0.3348750784006896`
- update W4/W5 and W5 typed diagnostics to record that the rapidity-window
  convention does not satisfy the W5 target `0.8804486068`; no W4/W5 promotion
  is claimed
# 2026-04-19

- add `DASHI/Pressure.agda` as the generic finite pressure algebra owner,
  exposing a five-level `Pressure` carrier together with `_⊑p_`, `_⊔p_`,
  upper-bound / least-upper-bound laws, and monotonicity lemmas
- add `Ontology/Hecke/PressureAdapter.agda` as the first thin domain adapter,
  embedding Hecke `PressureClass` into the generic pressure carrier and proving
  the existing `_≤P_` order maps monotonically into `_⊑p_`
- thread the generic pressure carrier into the first Hecke representative
  computation records.
  `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/ExitToAnchoredRepresentativeComputations.agda`, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda`
  now each expose both the local `PressureClass` tier and the embedded generic
  `Pressure` tier, together with the exact low/medium/high witness for the
  current representative class
- add `Ontology/Hecke/RepresentativePressureOrder.agda` as the first
  theorem-thin generic pressure comparison surface over those Hecke
  representatives.
  It proves the embedded generic ordering
  `stay <= anchored <= immediate-exit`
  without introducing any new pressure source or widening the current owner
  boundary beyond Hecke
- extend that same Hecke comparison surface with the first generic-pressure
  join/summary laws over the representative lanes.
  `Ontology/Hecke/RepresentativePressureOrder.agda`
  now also proves
  `stay ⊔ anchored = anchored`
  and
  `(stay ⊔ anchored) ⊔ immediate-exit = immediate-exit`
  on the embedded generic carrier
- add the first bounded promotion from the weighted valuation forward lane
  into the theorem-side delta bridge.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `weightedValuationForwardCandidateToDeltaBridge`
  plus
  `weightedValuationForwardCandidateNormalizesQuadratic`,
  so a weighted forward candidate can be reused by the theorem-side bridge
  once a signature bridge is supplied, without widening the open
  cancellation-pressure seam
- update `README.md` and `TODO.md` to record the ownership split:
  generic pressure algebra now lives in `DASHI/`,
  while `Ontology/Hecke/*Pressure*` remains the domain-specific consumer lane
## 2026-05-13 W4/W5 LHAPDF environment clarification

- Clarified the W4/W5 PDF-intake docs after system LHAPDF was installed:
  `/usr/bin/lhapdf`, `/usr/bin/lhapdf-config`, and system Python `lhapdf` are
  available at `6.5.5`, while the repo-local `.venv` still lacks the Python
  binding. CT18NLO resolves with
  `LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=/usr/share/lhapdf/LHAPDF:$PWD/scripts/data/pdf`; no W4/W5
  promotion follows until accepted DY/PDF convention authority is supplied.

## 2026-05-13 non-limited paper interface diagnostic lock-in

- Ran the two blocking interface diagnostics directly against the current repo
  instead of spawning another conditional worker round. `DASHIState` is only a
  dependent carrier package (`Carrier : Set`, `carrierValue : Carrier`) with no
  hidden `FactorVec`/`NormalForm`/p2 update surface, so G3/GR now require an
  explicit adapter/specializer or narrowed selected-state consumer.
- Confirmed the SFGC gauge surface is one-dimensional at the exposed API:
  `GaugeField = ShiftPressurePoint -> Phase4`, `SFGCShiftRightEdge =
  ShiftPressurePoint`, and the edge target is `SSL.rightNeighbor`. No
  `shiftPrime`, `ShiftDirection`, or transverse edge exists, so G2 now requires
  a real two-direction/transverse-edge API before a nondegenerate plaquette or
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField` can be constructed.
- Updated `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` to lock these routes
  and prevent more Route A/B/C conditional surface churn. No gate promotion is
  claimed.

## 2026-05-13 selected-carrier / prime-lattice concrete tranche

- Added `DASHI/Geometry/PrimeLattice.agda` as the first standalone
  prime-lattice geometry layer over `Ontology.GodelLattice.FactorVec` and
  `Ontology.Hecke.FactorVecInstances.primeBump`. It defines edges, 2-cells,
  square endpoint sharing via `primeBumpCommutes`, and coefficient-parametric
  `δ₀`, `δ₁`, and `δ₁∘δ₀-zero`. This is a G2 prerequisite only; no
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier` or Maxwell promotion is claimed.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/G3ConcreteOperators.agda`, a concrete selected
  operator package over the existing `selectedG3FactorVecDASHIState`, with p2
  and spatial prime-bump operators plus `PP`/`HP` commutation and p2 filtration
  witnesses. G3 remains unpromoted because the wave-function scalar
  ring/bracket semantics, associated-graded Galilei identification, and
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` are still missing.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRConcreteLeviCivita.agda`, connecting the
  selected FactorVec-backed G3 state to the existing flat constant Minkowski
  finite-r Levi-Civita prerequisite. This closes only the flat selected
  prerequisite; non-flat GR remains open.
- Imported the new modules from `DASHI/Everything.agda` and updated the worker
  coordination board / TODO surfaces to record exact non-promotion boundaries.

## 2026-05-16 Paper 1 narrative geometry pass

- Updated `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and the TeX
  source with a dedicated "Why the Carrier Geometry Is Forced" section. The
  new bridge explains ternary unresolvedness, recursive trie refinement,
  ultrametric distance, prime-lane independence, projection-defect residuals,
  and filtration as one carrier geometry before the manuscript enters the
  formal construction inventory.
- Refined the G6 prose so cross-lane commuting reads as tracked independence
  of distinct valuation exponents on the official `GL.FactorVec` route, while
  preserving the full `LaneOperator` non-promotion boundary.

## 2026-05-16 Paper 1 derivation-priority pass

- Replaced the early closure/frontier-style summary with a derivation map that
  keeps target equations and carrier-to-physics adapters visually central.
- Added derivation lemmas for the abelian/nonabelian gauge split, the
  quotient-grade commutator obstruction, and the Einstein tensor as the
  divergence-free source-facing curvature target.
- Moved the origins/trits/Base369/video lineage out of the main derivation
  path into appendix-style context after the claim-boundary sections.

## 2026-05-19 knot/weave topology culture bridge

- Added `DASHI/Culture/KnotWeaveTopologyCultureBridge.agda` as a theorem-thin
  culture bridge carrying knot, weave, and braid as bounded
  semantic/topological operator carriers.
- Linked the bridge into the observation transport spine and
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and documented the non-promotion boundary: no
  cultural universal, identity/qualia closure, context-free equivalence, or
  authority promotion is claimed.

## 2026-05-19 Paper 7 tmux proof-blocker orchestration

- Added a proof-blocker wave section to `Docs/AutonomousExecutionBrief.md`
  requiring the next six Paper 7 managers to implement against exact named
  blockers rather than returning another broad audit pass.
- Added `.autonomous-orchestrator/runners.json` with the six manager lanes,
  parent metadata, and lane claims needed for the tmux-backed autonomous
  orchestrator dashboard.

## 2026-05-21 Middle6 downstream-after-five-blockers wave

- Collected the assigned downstream worker wave for the post-five-blocker
  frontier. New fail-closed receipts record Friedrichs/self-adjoint and
  continuum spectral-transport targets, Hodge variation/discrete-IBP targets,
  sourced Einstein equation surfaces, Tomita-Takesaki and Stone physical
  Hamiltonian targets, DHR tensor/statistics/hexagon/DR reconstruction targets,
  and physical Yukawa/DHR intertwiner targets.
- Wired the worker returns into
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` via
  `canonicalMiddle6DownstreamAfterFiveBlockersLedger`. The four Gate 8 proof
  obligations remain explicitly false, and `terminalClaimPromoted` remains
  false.
- No external authority token was fabricated or promoted. Clay/UniformBalaban,
  W4/Candidate256, exact selected non-flat YM curvature, selected metric
  compatibility, DASHI local algebra, DHR reconstruction, and exact
  DHR/Yukawa compatibility remain the controlling frontier.

## 2026-05-21 Middle6 first-missing hard-math iteration

- Collected the six-lane first-missing wave and wired it into
  `canonicalMiddle6FirstMissingHardMathIterationLedger`.  Gate 2 now records
  canonical finite Casimir modes with gap value `1`; Gate 3 records the exact
  finite-curvature-to-user-connection type mismatch; Gate 4 adds a
  Christoffel-aware doubled-`2Γ` input plus finite `4R`/Ricci/scalar/`2G`
  receipt; Gate 5 threads scoped C-star authority and GNS quotient descent;
  Gate 6 records the semantic identity-action adapter target; and Gate 7
  records `Q[i]` CP-phase/Jarlskog bookkeeping.
- The iteration is still fail-closed.  The finite `H_YM` spectrum API,
  `YMSFGCUserSuppliedNonFlatConnectionCarrier` bridge, selected metric
  compatibility rebind, `missingDASHILocalAlgebra`, arbitrary-sector DHR
  identity semantics, exact normalized CKM matrices over `Q[i]`, and external
  Clay/W4/Candidate256 boundaries remain open.
- `terminalClaimPromoted` remains false; no Clay, W4/W5, Candidate256,
  Doplicher-Roberts, Standard Model, physical Yukawa, or continuum mass-gap
  authority token was fabricated.

## 2026-05-21 Middle6 Schrödinger-clock hard-blocker iteration

- Collected the requested 18-lane hard-blocker tranche and integrated the
  returned receipts into
  `canonicalMiddle6SchrodingerClockHardBlockerIterationLedger`.
- Gate 3 now has a typed bridge from SFGC discrete 1-forms into the
  user-supplied non-flat YM connection carrier shape. Gate 4 now consumes the
  doubled-Christoffel selected-metric compatibility witness and records the
  remaining Levi-Civita blocker, while Ricci contraction is staged as a
  site-local fibre to avoid the old global eager normalization path.
- Gate 5/6/7 gained scoped C-star/GNS descent, algebra-indexed DHR identity
  adapter, tensor-dual adapter, and Gaussian-rational CKM/Jarlskog bookkeeping
  receipts. All are still fail-closed where the actual theorem evidence is
  absent.
- Validation: targeted GR/YM/QFT modules pass, terminal composition passes,
  and `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library
  DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0. No terminal, Clay, W4/W5, Candidate256,
  Doplicher-Roberts, Standard Model, physical Yukawa, exact CKM, or continuum
  mass-gap promotion was made.
## 2026-06-02 sibling codec / fining / continuous support

- Added `DASHI.Physics.Closure.SiblingCodecFiningContinuousSupportReceipt`.
- Recorded local-archive and sibling-repo support for:
  - triadic quotient video codec context,
  - balanced ternary residual planes and rANS/context coding,
  - motion-compensated residuals with MDL side bits,
  - six-layer codec `E_seq` fining sheets,
  - signed anisotropic residual atoms with orientation, anisotropy, phase, and
    twist,
  - continuous lens topology / 369 overlay artifacts,
  - dashiRTX PDA-MDL and quadtree ultrametric light transport demos.
- Wired the new receipt into `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- Kept all promotion boundaries closed: production codec, Gate 3 density,
  continuum theorem, NS regularity, YM mass gap, MP4 generalisation, and Clay
  claims remain false.
- Extended the receipt after the remaining archive-thread review wave:
  - consumed `DNA Cassette Tape Comeback` for DNA UV/Haar detail sheets and
    4-adic supervoxel analogy,
  - consumed `DASHI learner context` and `DASHI learner context2` for
    tree-Haar/detail-band learner observables and video/runtime diagnostics,
  - consumed `DASHI MAIN MATH DEC` for triadic-first codec design,
  - consumed the blocker/PUMUL thread for Base369/PNF/pressure/wave/RG routing,
  - consumed `Branch · Math Mysticism Breakdown` for
    369/supervoxel/anisotropy/twist modeling grammar,
  - explicitly classified personal/no-title execution and hygiene traces as
    reviewed but non-promoting.

## 2026-06-20 NS determinant-side telemetry pass

- Added `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSDeterminantAreaRouteTargetReceipt` to record
  the corrected determinant-side `det(S)^+ -> |Omega_K| -> H_area` target and
  to mark the old `Qvel -> Omega_K` bridge invalid for the strain-side set.
- Added `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSSardBoundaryRegularityReceipt` to record the
  `lambda2 = 0` boundary carrier, the regular-point framing, the boundary
  `delta1 = |lambda1|` identity, and the a.e. `delta1 > 0` partial closure.
- Added three empirical NS telemetry/checker lanes:
  `ns_betchov_identity_scan`,
  `ns_det_omega_k_measure_scan`,
  `ns_lambda2_boundary_regularity_scan`.
- Updated `scripts/ns_betchov_determinant_sign_scan.py` and its checker so the
  legacy-axis warning no longer downgrades otherwise complete runs and the
  aggregate sign-success fraction is recorded explicitly.
- Wired the new determinant-side receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and the
  new telemetry lanes into `scripts/local_clay_harness_manifest.py`.
- Kept all theorem/Clay promotion gates closed; the determinant-side `H_area`
  route and the quantitative `delta1 >= 1` gate remain open.
