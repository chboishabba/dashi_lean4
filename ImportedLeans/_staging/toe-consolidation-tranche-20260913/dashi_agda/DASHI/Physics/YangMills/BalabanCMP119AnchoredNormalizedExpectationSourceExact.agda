-- "Convergent Renormalization Expansions for Lattice Gauge Theories",

-- SOURCE LOCATOR / MATHEMATICAL CONTENT
--
-- In Sect. 3, around equations (3.44)--(3.47), Bałaban treats expectation
-- values by expanding BOTH numerator and normalization denominator.  The
-- numerator contains a distinguished localization domain Z_0 carrying the
-- inserted bond/point.  The remaining denominator polymers exponentiate; after
-- subtraction of the denominator exponent and a Mayer re-expansion, the
-- normalized expectation is represented as a sum over domains X containing
-- that distinguished insertion.
--
-- The source then states that these anchored terms satisfy the same exponential
-- localization estimate as the boundary terms in (2.42), with the appropriate
-- small prefactor (O(p_1(g_k)) in the displayed application).  This is exactly
-- the connected/denominator-cancellation mechanism needed by the continuum
-- increment route.  It is stronger than merely knowing that the action density
-- itself has exponentially localized E/R/B terms.
--
-- This file gives that published result its own theorem boundary.  It does NOT
-- claim that an arbitrary repository observable is automatically one of the
-- source insertions.  The remaining same-object job is to place the ordinary
-- Schwinger and compact-support characteristic insertions inside the source
-- local analytic insertion class.
