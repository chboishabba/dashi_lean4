# 2026-06-24 ACL Schur-test proof repair

- Split the mixed-tail ACL receipt boundary into the checked sampled witness
  and the still-open profile-independent bound on the canonical Agda surface.
- Added timing and structured logging to the analytic proof runner so the run
  now emits `started_at`, `finished_at`, `elapsed_ms`, and a compact event
  log alongside the summary artifacts.
- Ran the targeted Agda wrapper on
  `NSTriadKNMixedTailACLOperatorNormAuditReceipt.agda` and
  `NSTriadKNMixedTailACLSchurResidueProofPlanReceipt.agda` only; `Everything.agda`
  was not run.
- Ran the proof script and verified the generated summary artifact; the
  receipt assertions now match the canonical constructor names.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 58 normalized packet-action inflation

- Added `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_sprint58_normalized_action_inflation_audit.py`
  and a synthetic truth test.
- Added `--replay-sprint58-normalized-action-inflation-summary` to
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py`, with replay tests and fail-closed
  promotion flags.
- Added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftyEightNormalizedActionInflationReceipt.agda`
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- Batch result over the existing Sprint 49 N32/N64 GPU material-parent audits:
  `NORMALIZED_ACTION_NONADDITIVE_RATIO_INFLATION`; the covered sum-of-local
  ratios over ratio-of-sums factor is `4904.346096600663`.
- Current NS packet-normalized source ledger is not additive at vessel level;
  raw action or energy-weighted normalized action is the next safer object.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 57 vessel/action reconciliation

- Added `../dashiCFD/scripts/ns_sprint57_vessel_action_reconciliation_audit.py`
  and a synthetic truth test.
- Added `--replay-sprint57-vessel-action-summary` to
  `scripts/ns_diagnostic_harness.py`, with replay tests and fail-closed
  promotion flags.
- Added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ClaySprintFiftySevenVesselActionReconciliationReceipt.agda`
  and wired it through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- Batch result over the existing Sprint 49 N32/N64 GPU material-parent audits:
  `PACKET_ACTION_UNDERCOUNTS_COVERED_STRETCH`; raw packet positive action is
  below covered/global raw positive stretch, while normalized packet action is
  far above normalized global action.
- Current NS blocker is normalized packet-action inflation versus raw
  vessel-action reconstruction, not proven Euclidean double-counting.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 56 packet-local accumulated stretch-action audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` Sprint 56 packet-local accumulated stretch-action
  producer and `dashi_agda` replay mode.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint56_packet_local_stretch_action_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint56_packet_local_stretch_action_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `PACKET_LOCAL_ACTION_SUMMABILITY_BLOCKED`.
  Packet-local masks reconstruct from Sprint 49 `K_cell` geometry, but the
  packet-local action-small fraction is only `0.8108028335301063`, with
  `dangerous_lineage_count = 641` and `sigma_packet_local_action_fit =
  -0.4822543927548197`.
- Direction-change separation is recorded separately:
  `direction_change_integral_total = 38406.84183964504` and
  `redirection_without_overwhelm_count = 790`.
- No NS, Gate3, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 55 Lagrangian accumulated stretch-action audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` Sprint 55 Lagrangian accumulated stretch-action producer
  and `dashi_agda` replay mode.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint55_lagrangian_stretch_action_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint55_lagrangian_stretch_action_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `LAGRANGIAN_STRETCH_ACTION_SMALL_DIAGNOSTIC`.
  The shell-lineage action audit reports `action_small_fraction =
  0.9985242030696576`, `dangerous_lineage_count = 5`, and
  `sigma_action_fit = -0.5102412568825301`.
- According to Sprint 55, the Sprint 54 stretch diagnostic should be read as
  Lagrangian accumulated stretch-action evidence, not as color strings or
  packet-color counts. Packet-local support masks, weighted action summability,
  cadence/shell-boundary sensitivity, physical bridge, stretch absorption, and
  no-blowup remain open.
- No NS, Gate3, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 54 no-2-cycle resolution/cadence audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` Sprint 54 no-2-cycle resolution/cadence producer and
  `dashi_agda` replay mode.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint54_no2cycle_resolution_cadence_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint54_no2cycle_resolution_cadence_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `NO2CYCLE_PROXY_OVERCONSERVATIVE_STRETCH_SMALL`.
  The material mass proxy remains bad, but shell/time direct `omega dot S omega`
  evidence marks `8047 / 8252` proxy failures as stretch-small. Cadence is still
  `single_cadence_unresolved`, packet-local stretch masks are unavailable, and
  `sigma_stretching_amplitude = -0.6060245931540146`.
- No NS, Gate3, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 53 no-2-cycle physical amplitude audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` Sprint 53 physical no-2-cycle amplitude producer and
  `dashi_agda` replay mode.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint53_no2cycle_physical_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint53_no2cycle_physical_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `MATERIAL_SOURCE_GATE_CLOSED_PHYSICAL_NO2CYCLE_AMPLITUDE_BLOCKED`.
  Material true-new source remains absent, but the physical net-residue
  amplitude proxy does not clear: `5427 / 8252` proxy failures remain large,
  only `2825` are physical-amplitude-small, and `sigma_physical_cycle_fit =
  -1.1215088689186317`.
- No NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 52 material source / no-2-cycle audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` Sprint 52 material/no-2-cycle producer and
  `dashi_agda` replay mode.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint52_material_no2cycle_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint52_material_no2cycle_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `MATERIAL_SOURCE_GATE_CLOSED_NO2CYCLE_AMPLITUDE_BLOCKED`.
  Material true-new source is absent under Sprint 49 advected material parents,
  but no-2-cycle amplitude remains blocked: `6993 / 9126` proxy failures are
  amplitude-small, below the 90% diagnostic threshold.
- No NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 51 signed ternary flip audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` signed ternary flip producer and `dashi_agda` replay
  mode.
- The producer keeps Sprint 50 attribution rules but treats minus/plus as an
  involutive pair, reporting raw flip flow, counter-flow, signed imbalance,
  net residue Lyapunov proxy, BT proxy signed decay, and no-2-cycle diagnostic.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint51_signed_ternary_flip_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint51_signed_ternary_flip_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `NO2CYCLE_FAILS`. Raw minus-to-plus is substantially balanced by
  plus-to-minus (`0.048767829281919015` imbalance fraction), and BT proxy
  signed decay passes; persistent flip-cycle proxy failures are now the active
  obstruction.
- No NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 50 full ternary cross-shell audit

- Added the `dashiCFD` full ternary cross-shell matrix producer and the
  `dashi_agda` replay mode.
- The producer derives source kind from `parent_relation` plus shell delta and
  derives transitions from `parent_state -> child_state`; Sprint 49
  `classification` is not used for source-kind attribution.
- Batch output:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint50_full_ternary_cross_shell_gpu_audit/`.
- Replay output:
  `Docs/Images/clay-analytic-sprint/sprint50_full_ternary_cross_shell_gpu_replay/`.
- Result: `CROSS_PLUS_FROM_MINUS_DOMINATES`; zero-to-plus cross-shell source is
  absent in the observed prefix, while minus-to-plus exceeds plus-to-plus.
- No NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 49 GPU material-parent batch

- Ran and replayed Sprint 49 material-parent summaries from `dashiCFD` GPU
  truth artifacts for N32/N64 seed0/seed1.
- `dashiCFD` batch summary:
  `../dashiCFD/outputs/sprint49_material_parent_gpu_batch/sprint49_material_parent_gpu_batch_summary.json`.
- Result: true-new material source is zero in the batch; tracking uncertainty
  does not dominate; weighted cross-shell source dominates and routes to
  `ADJACENT_PACKET_THEOREM_INSUFFICIENT`.
- Patched the `dashiCFD` producer route aggregation so a small tracking term
  cannot override a dominant cross-shell weighted source.
- No NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-04 Sprint 44 NS residue semantics audit

- Extended the NS diagnostic harness with the explicit Sprint 44 residue
  semantics audit and theta-grid summary.
- Added `Rplus_strain` as a principal positive-strain alignment residue,
  separate from the direct `Rplus_stretchSign` proxy.
- Added `zeroR_positiveQ` accounting so strict/relaxed semantics that miss
  positive physical stretching fail visibly.
- Added the Sprint 44 Agda receipt and docs/governance pointers.
- No NS, Gate3, YM, terminal, or Clay promotion follows.

# 2026-06-03 Sprint 43 YM all-diameter KP/rho/leakage harness

- Added a within-repo YM harness for the p=7 all-diameter KP/rho/leakage
  diagnostic surface.
- The script computes geometric KP tails, strict margin, rho target, leakage
  tail, connected-animal side diagnostics, and explicit proof-certificate
  gates from local CSV or smoke rows.
- Added the Sprint 43 Agda receipt and docs/governance pointers.
- No continuum YM, mass gap, Balaban transfer, OS/Wightman, Gate3, NS, or Clay
  promotion follows.

# 2026-06-02 nested 15SSP coordinate grammar integration

- Updated `SSP7Plus7Plus1AtomGrammarReceipt` so the carrier grammar records
  the internal refinement `15SSP = 7 Hecke + 7 mirror-Hecke + p71 sign`, with
  each septet read as `7 = 3D + 3D + sign`.
- Recorded that each 15SSP digit/lane contains depth-many nested 15SSP blocks.
  This is the symmetry-complexity series behind the `p^(3d)` Archimedean
  density term used by the 3D gravity/Gate3 taper calculation.
- Wired the atom grammar receipt into `ClayContinuumMathTransitionReceipt` so
  the final Clay ledger consumes the coordinate semantics directly.
- No Gate3, YM, NS, gravity, Clay, or terminal promotion follows.

# 2026-06-02 locked four-chart analytic capstone

- Updated `ClayComputedVisualizationSynthesisReceipt` so the chart ledger uses
  the locked sprint constants: gravity 3D `p=3` is the binding PAWOTG
  constraint with `sigma_crit = 0.3025113508228815`; the digit baseline
  `sigma = 0.2886751345948129` gives `S_3D,p3 = 0.7228939450291813 < 1`.
- Recorded the YM chart as the T7-compressed Balaban gulf:
  physical `beta=6` has `r = 2.7017782`, while the conservative target is
  `beta_eff > 15.84`.
- Recorded the NS chart as a Path A / Path B split: `H^-1/2` defect divergence
  is the publishable obstruction, while the Clay-facing route is the
  non-circular `H^{11/8}` Bernoulli band plus density.
- Recorded the Gate3 chart as phase-completeness evidence:
  MirrorA + MirrorB7 + sign is required for frame stability.
- The receipt remains a visual/evidence ledger only; no proof or promotion
  flags changed.

# 2026-06-02 gravity Vladimirov 3D frame correction

- Corrected `GRVladimirovFrameDiagnosticReceipt` and
  `GravityVladimirovFrameReceipt` for the 3D/macroscopic PAWOTG reading:
  depth density is `p^(3d)`, so the binding condition is
  `sigma_crit_3D(p=3) ~= 0.3025113508228815`.
- Digit expansion still passes narrowly at
  `sigma_digit ~= 0.2886751345948129`, with
  `S_3D,p3(sigma_digit) ~= 0.7228939450291813`.
- The gravity trit table remains: p-adic Vladimirov spectrum `+1`,
  Archimedean 3D frame theorem `0`, Schwarzschild/W4 match `-1`; lane status
  `0` suspended.
- No carrier-derived GR or precision-gravity promotion follows.

# 2026-06-02 binary-to-tetralemma margin governance

- Added and wired `BinaryTetralemmaMarginStateReceipt`.
- It records the diagnostic refinement from a binary pass/fail margin to four
  states: true/absorbed, false/leaking, both/mixed, and neither/wrong-seam.
- The final promotion gate remains binary and fail-closed.  The new receipt is
  consumed by `ClayFinalAnalyticFrontierMapReceipt` as governance only.

# 2026-06-02 Gate3 nesting / YM T7 quotient evidence

- Added and wired `Gate3NestingTaperConditionReceipt`.
- It corrects the Gate 3 sampler diagnosis: Kozyrev wavelets are orthogonal in
  `L2(Q_p)` with identity Gram; the finite-frame CSV failure is Archimedean
  parent-child nesting after digit expansion.  PAWOTG is now the Gaussian
  taper condition that damps the nesting term.  Digit-expansion
  `sigma~=0.2887 < 0.5052` remains the positive model; SSP/CM/Hecke taper is
  still open.
- Added and wired `YMMonsterQuotientEvidenceReceipt`.
- It records McKay-Thompson `T_7` compression evidence: raw Monster
  `c2=21493760`, `T_7(q^2)=204`, compression about `105000`, conservative
  `C0_eff~=2`, and `beta_abs~=15.836`.  This supports quotient control but
  does not prove the actual YM polymer entropy theorem.

# 2026-06-02 Monster / 15SSP quotient control

- Added and wired `YMC0EntropyThresholdSensitivityReceipt`.
- It records the YM KP strict absorption formula
  `beta_abs(C0) = (a + log(2 p C0)) / c_min`, the checked C0 table
  `0.5/1/2/5 -> 10.107/12.971/15.836/19.622`, and Monster re-2 stress
  `c1=196884`, `c2=21493760`, `c2/c1 ~= 109.17`, `sqrt ~= 10.45`.
- It consumes the existing KP threshold and Monster quotient receipts and keeps
  quotient control, YM mass gap, and Clay promotion false.
- Added and wired `MonsterMoonshineSSPQuotientControlReceipt`.
- The receipt consumes the existing FactorVec/SSP carrier, Monster prime-lane,
  supersingular prime bridge, Monster-to-SSP map, Monster order/j-distribution,
  YM KP, Gate 3 PAWOTG, NS theta, and Clay asymmetry surfaces.
- It records raw `c2/c1 ~= 109` as representation multiplicity, not physical
  polymer/overlap/tail entropy, and keeps quotient entropy control open.
- All promotion flags remain false.
- Added and wired `Gate3AtomSamplerPAWOTGQualityReceipt`.
- Gate 3 sampler obstruction: current finite-frame sampler has
  `mu_N ~= 0.93--1.00`, `(N-1)mu_N >> 1`, negative Gershgorin bounds,
  numerical `A_N=0`, and max frame ratio about `2.73e16`.  Phase-complete wins
  at `N=8` but does not prevent larger-`N` collapse.
- Replacement target is `AtomSamplerPAWOTGQuality`: `mu_N <= C/N`, or at least
  `(N-1)mu_N < 1`.  Digit-expansion PAWOTG remains valid; the current atom
  sampler must be replaced.  Monster leakage would tighten the p=3 threshold
  to about `0.296`/`0.228`.  No promotion follows.

# 2026-06-02 computed lemma update

- Docs/governance lane: recorded `MonsterMoonshineSSPQuotientControl` above
  YM/Gate3 as a quotient/compression blocker.  15SSP/moonshine may reduce
  effective contour entropy only if a quotient theorem is proved; it is not an
  entropy multiplier, and raw `c2/c1 ~= 109` is not physical polymer entropy
  `C0`.  Keep the branches fail-closed: quotient gives `C0_eff ~= 1` and
  `beta_abs ~= 12.97`; sqrt/raw leakage raises thresholds to about
  `22.66`/`32.35`.  No quotient theorem, PAWOTG theorem, YM mass gap, Clay, or
  terminal promotion was introduced.

- Added and wired
  `Gate3DigitExpansionPAWOTGPartialResultReceipt`,
  `YMCharacterExpansionContinuumReformulationReceipt`, and
  `NSThetaPressureMarginCorrectionReceipt`.
- Gate 3: recorded the digit-expansion map as a real PAWOTG partial result:
  `Var=1/12`, `sigma ~= 0.2887`, below the `0.5052` threshold, uniformly in
  prime and improving with BT depth.  The SSP/CM/Hecke embedding identity is
  still the open theorem.
- YM: recorded the character-expansion transfer-matrix fixed-lattice gap and
  reframed the physical bridge as continuum survival, not existence at
  `beta=6`.
- NS: corrected the comparison language.  `H^{11/8}` is spatially stronger
  than `H^{1/2}`; theta remains tail-localized and conditional, and high-high
  paraproduct control remains the wall.
- All promotion flags remain false.

# 2026-06-02 final reduction receipts

- Added `Gate3AdelicLocalizationReductionReceipt`,
  `YMBetaBridgeQuantitativeGapReceipt`, and
  `NSNonCircularObstructionReceipt`.
- The Gate 3 receipt consumes the existing PAWOTG/Gate 3 surfaces and records
  the exact reduction to uniform Archimedean localization below
  `sigma_crit(p=3)=0.5052`.
- The YM receipt consumes the physical beta bridge and Paper 3 surfaces,
  records gaps `4.11`/`6.97`, and quantifies the naive perturbative bridge as
  `exp(150) ~= 10^65`.
- The NS receipt consumes the theta/BKM, danger-shell, conditional maximum
  principle, and paraproduct surfaces, and records the high-high paraproduct
  circularity obstruction.  All three keep promotion lists empty.

# 2026-06-02 Clay prize lemma roadmap

- Added `Docs/ClayPrizeLemmaRoadmap.md` to answer the direct "what gets us to
  Clay solved" question without changing any theorem status.
- The new doc separates solved architecture from prize lemmas: shared margin
  grammar, scale-graph target, theta/rho/Gate 3 surfaces, and support grammar
  are not Clay closure.
- The work order is now explicit: actual `p=7` YM polymer activity and
  Balaban recurrence; Gate 3 phase-complete frame/density/Mosco/no-pollution/
  mass-shell transfer; then the NS fixed-`K` LP identity and danger-shell
  maximum principle.
- This was documentation/governance only.  It introduced no Agda changes, no
  proof promotion, no continuum transfer, and no Clay claim.

# 2026-06-02 SSP 7+7+1 frame decomposition

- Added `PressureDepthLengthTripleReceipt` to keep length, depth, and pressure
  distinct: log-weighted BT path length, resolved carry depth, and unresolved
  carry pressure.
- Added `SSPSevenSevenOneFrameDecompositionReceipt` as the Gate 3 bridge for
  the 7+7+1 atom-frame idea.  It preserves the semantic mirror partition while
  recording the literal CM arithmetic audit separately.
- Important correction: the literal split/inert classification for
  `Q(sqrt(-7))` does not match the semantic septets, and `p71` is split for
  `(-7/p)`, not inert.  The useful frame claim is therefore conditional frame
  bookkeeping, not a literal CM splitting theorem.
- Gate 3 remains open: the receipt records `A_split * A_inert * A_71` as the
  lower-bound organization and identifies phase completeness as necessary for
  the inert factor, but no uniform frame lower bound or continuum lift is
  promoted.

# 2026-06-02 NS Paper 1 Clay target

- Implemented the Manager-B NS Paper 1 receipt chain: fixed-`K` LP identity
  analytic surface, danger-shell maximum-principle target, conditional
  `theta < 1` tail-decay theorem, actual NS-to-EV5 projection up to an LP
  commutator defect, and the Paper 1 Clay-target spine.
- Added `Docs/NSPaper1ClayTarget.md` and the sibling dashiCFD theta sweep
  script.  The script writes `promotion_status=NO_PROMOTION` for every row and
  is a finite diagnostic only.
- The hard mathematical target is unchanged and now sharper: prove the
  danger-shell maximum principle/edge-leakage bound.  No BKM, global
  regularity, arbitrary-data, or Clay promotion was made.

# 2026-06-02 local docs / 369 support integration

- Rechecked local docs and receipts for the requested local concepts:
  domain-specific pressure/PNF, RG, wave/spectral formalisms, wave/light
  transport, stationary-phase refraction/rainbow, simulation/nature transport,
  TITAN/Bryan boundary material, and 3-6-9 voxel/supervoxel bookkeeping.
- Added `LocalDocs369UnificationSupportReceipt`, which consumes
  `ITIRPNFPressureUnificationSupportReceipt`, `CanonicalCodecAtomReceipt`,
  `CarryMemorySubvoxelReceipt`, `DialecticalCarrierSevenSevenOneReceipt`, and
  `DialecticalAtomFrontierReceipt`.
- The receipt records 369 as unification support grammar only: ternary support,
  six-fold orientation, nine-cell majority, and 27-cell supervoxel boundary.
  It preserves the fail-closed boundaries: no runtime codec, Gate 3 density,
  p71 time theorem, psychology theorem, NS/YM theorem, or Clay promotion.

# 2026-06-02 ITIR/PNF pressure support integration

- Audited the requested `../ITIR-suite` materials and local DASHI surfaces for
  PNF, domain-fenced residual pressure, RG toy/coarse-graining status,
  spectral post-selection, wave/light transport, stationary-phase
  refraction/rainbow, LES/GLES simulation, evolutionary/nature transport,
  anisotropy/TITAN framing, and Bryan/blueprint boundaries.
- Added `ITIRPNFPressureUnificationSupportReceipt`, consuming the existing
  PNF residual spectral severity, Hecke PNF bridge, intersectional pressure/
  anisotropy, explicit RG, and normalized RG proof receipts.
- The receipt includes the requested concepts as support lanes while enforcing
  non-promotion: PNF is evidence-only residual pressure, spectral retrieval is
  post-selector, RG remains conditional, transport/nature/refraction lanes
  remain bounded observation supports, and TITAN/Bryan remain exposition
  guards.

# 2026-06-02 Manager publishable stack receipt

- Added `PublishableFullUnificationStackReceipt` to make the publication
  stack itself a checked object rather than only prose governance.
- The receipt ties together `FullUnificationPublicationRoadmapReceipt`,
  `StrictMarginImpliesAbsorptionReceipt`,
  `NSTailFluxAbsorptionMarginReceipt`, `YMPaper3RoadmapReceipt`,
  `Gate3NormDictionaryReceipt`, `UnifiedMarginInvariantReceipt`, and
  `MarginInvariantProgrammeFrontierReceipt`.
- The checked state is deliberately fail-closed: Paper 0 is publishable as
  grammar, downstream lane papers are conditional, and full closure/Clay
  promotion remains false.

# 2026-06-02 Manager publication docs governance

- Updated the full-unification roadmap to match
  `FullUnificationPublicationRoadmapReceipt`: the publication package is Papers
  0-4, not an implicit claim from older lane-gate prose.
- Added the exact Paper 0-4 scope: shared margin grammar; NS theta/EV5; Gate 3
  cutoff-frame/density/Mosco; YM rho/KP/Balaban; and the final full-DASHI
  composition paper.
- Added explicit forbidden claims and repeated the live promotion gates so the
  docs cannot be read as claiming NS regularity, YM mass gap, Gate 3 promotion,
  Clay, terminal, exact SM/GRQFT, or empirical adequacy beyond accepted
  receipts.

# 2026-06-02 Manager YM Paper 3 roadmap implementation

- Implemented the YM-only Paper 3 receipt chain:
  `YMSamePrimeOverlapReductionReceipt`,
  `YMBTPathCountingKPThresholdReceipt`,
  `YMKPAbsorptionMarginThresholdReceipt`,
  `YMActualPolymerActivityDefinitionReceipt`,
  `YMBalabanRGScaleTransferFrontierReceipt`, and
  `YMPaper3RoadmapReceipt`.
- The receipts consume the existing KP coupling and Bruhat-Tits reduction
  surfaces, split convergence from strict absorption, and make actual
  p=7 Wilson polymer activity the next concrete missing definition before
  any `rho < 1` KP claim can be used.
- The RG frontier records that perturbative beta bookkeeping remains below
  the strict `p=7` threshold, so the Balaban scale-transfer step is still
  hard open.  No continuum Yang-Mills, mass gap, Clay, or terminal promotion
  was introduced.
- Supplemental worker modules with overlapping detail were typechecked and
  imported rather than discarded:
  `ActualPolymerActivityDefinitionReceipt`,
  `BalabanRGScaleTransferFrontierReceipt`,
  `Paper3YMDependencyGraphReceipt`,
  `YMBruhatTitsPathCountingKPThresholdReceipt`, and
  `YMKPAbsorptionMarginReceipt`.
- Focused checks passed for the YM receipts and the full aggregate
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` validation passed with the standard repo flags.

# 2026-06-02 Manager L full unification roadmap

- Added `StrictMarginImpliesAbsorptionReceipt` as the L0.1-L0.4 core.
  The receipt records the missing dynamical premise explicitly:
  `R' <= P - A` must be supplied before `P <= theta*A` and `theta < 1`
  imply absorption.  `A > 0` is recorded as load-bearing for the ratio/signed
  margin equivalence.
- Added `FullUnificationPublicationRoadmapReceipt` to make Paper 0 the first
  publication object and to list the downstream joining lemmas for NS, Gate 3,
  and YM.  The roadmap keeps all downstream analytic inhabitants open.
- Corrected the Gate 3 publication wording: finite dictionaries only provide
  cutoff `A_N > 0` frame bounds on finite subspaces.  Continuum transfer still
  requires density, Mosco recovery, no spectral pollution, and mass-shell
  bridge.
- No NS regularity, YM mass gap, Gate 3 theorem, Clay theorem, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

# 2026-06-02 margin invariant implementation batch

- Implemented and imported the six strict-margin receipts:
  `NSTailFluxAbsorptionMarginReceipt`, `EV5ThetaMarginUpgradeReceipt`,
  `YMKPActivityRatioMarginReceipt`, `UnifiedMarginInvariantReceipt`,
  `DashiCFDThetaRuntimeDiagnosticReceipt`, and
  `MarginInvariantProgrammeFrontierReceipt`.
- The NS side records `TailCarry`, `Flux`, and `Diss` symbolically and makes
  `theta < 1` the conditional tail-absorption margin.  EV5 admissibility is
  now explicitly lane7 non-increasing plus lane2 bounded plus theta-margin
  evidence; dashiCFD is recorded as support/falsification only.
- The YM side records the analogous `rho < 1` KP activity-ratio margin, while
  preserving the corrected blockers: same-prime overlap/cross-term bound,
  Balaban induction, physical RG bridge, and Gate 3 lift.
- Focused receipt checks passed and the full aggregate `DASHI/Everything.agda`
  check passed.  All new receipts remain non-promoting: no Gate 3, NS, YM,
  Clay, or terminal theorem is introduced.

# 2026-06-02 atom carrier notation sidecar

- Lane 5 docs-only roadmap correction: `Theta < 1` is not `iff BKM`; it is a
  computable sufficient proxy/seam gauge.  Theta monotonicity is not assumed:
  compute the whole profile and danger shell.  The YM RG surface remains
  conditional, `beta_carrier = 16.7` is not theorem evidence, the `beta_min`
  obstruction remains, and Gate 3 atom-frame `A > 0` is open.  No Clay
  promotion follows.
- Lane 5 docs-only pressure correction: previous pressure-as-path-length
  wording is superseded by depth/count/carry/unresolved-tension semantics.
  Remaining gaps are concrete pressure functional, friendship/carry absorption
  theorem, and runtime codec.  No Gate 3 or Clay promotion follows.
- Added a bounded governance clarification for the atom programme and carrier
  notation.  The interval `0..1` is archimedean; decimal strings are
  TCP/notation/coarse views; SSP primes are multiplicatively independent
  p-adic samplers/lane labels.  The earlier overindexing reading is not a live
  claim: decimal positions are not one-to-one SSP prime or atom coordinates.
- Continued the docs-only 15-variable correction: the first seven variables
  are what/where/shape, the second seven are motion/dynamics/topology, and
  `p71` is sign/time.  Decimal/TCP strings remain notation/coarse views, not
  theorem content or carrier coordinates.
- Documentation-only update in the allowed root docs.  No Agda files,
  runtime/TCP semantics, Gate 3 analytic promotion, atom positivity promotion,
  or Clay/continuum promotion was introduced.

# 2026-06-01 Worker 4 Balaban/KP/ultrametric YM obligation update

- Updated the Balaban/RG, polymer/KP, carrier area-law, ultrametric bridge,
  and Clay YM roadmap surfaces to name the exact open induction target:
  KP/uniform-volume polymer bounds plus ultrametric large/small field control
  for `H_k -> H_{k+1}` with constants independent of lattice volume.
- Marked that target as the competitive YM contribution lane.  It remains
  open: no KP uniform-volume theorem, large-field tail estimate, counterterm
  control theorem, continuum RG convergence, Clay YM, OS/Wightman, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

# 2026-06-01 Worker 6 Clay proximity governance snapshot

- Governance-only status update across the owned root docs.  Recorded the
  current Clay-proximity ranking as:
  (1) `NS->EV5` forward simulation, (2) Gate3 finite adelic inequality,
  (3) Gate4 Hecke envelope, and (4) YM continuum external.
- Clarified that `dashiRTX`, Moonshine, and CKM are not Clay-proximate in the
  current state.  They remain outside the Clay blocker/evidence ordering even
  when they are useful as diagnostics, structural support, or separate
  arithmetic lanes.
- Boundaries preserved: `NS->EV5` remains an actual-flow comparison target,
  Gate3 remains a finite adelic inequality obligation, Gate4 remains a Hecke
  envelope boundary, and YM continuum remains external.  No Agda/code files,
  stubs, code receipts, Clay promotions, CKM promotions, Moonshine promotions,
  `dashiRTX` promotions, or commit/tag actions were introduced.

# 2026-06-01 new tranche governance sync

- Worker 5 governance-only follow-up across the owned docs.  Added the current
  tranche posture for `LightCodecTransportCorrespondenceTheorem`, finite
  FactorVec inequality scope, and the `NS->EV5` / `dashiCFD` lane.  The
  LightCodecTransport surface is recorded as theorem binding/correspondence
  plumbing only; finite FactorVec inequalities remain selected finite-carrier
  evidence; `NS->EV5` remains a projection/norm-comparison obligation lane;
  and `dashiCFD` remains empirical diagnostics.  No Agda files were edited and
  no Clay, NS, continuum, ontology, physics, or unification promotion was
  made.
- Governance-only update across the owned docs.  Recorded the new priority
  stack: clean the corrected `psi2` skeleton and branch wording first; keep
  `NS->EV5` as the projection frontier; treat `dashiCFD` experiments as
  evidence-only; keep the Gate3 norm dictionary as a live proof obligation;
  and scope the Moonshine/VOA fixed-point receipt to structural support for
  the SSP alphabet.
- Explicitly preserved the boundaries requested for this tranche.  No Agda
  work was required, no Clay/CKM/`Y_d`/unification promotion was made, and
  commit/tag remains conditional on validation rather than automatic from the
  governance update.

# 2026-05-31 helical phase diagram chase correction

- 2026-06-01 Worker 6 governance-only docs sync:
  `Docs/Paper6FinalDraftOutline.md`, `Docs/Paper6Section1Draft.md`,
  `Docs/Paper6Section6Draft.md`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `status.md`
  were updated to reflect the latest user math without Agda edits.  The stale
  zero-branch commutativity language is replaced by the corrected `psi2`
  convention: the existing `phi` branch matches `psi2` via
  `Frob_p2 = 4 = 2^2`.  `floor(log2(p))` is only a depth-grading Yukawa
  selector candidate; NS needs a cumulative actual-flow tail estimate;
  FRACTRAN admissibility is a carrier-side nonresonance sharpening for NS tail
  dominance only; the adelic Sobolev lane is now an automorphic `GL(1)` /
  Hecke-character proof obligation; and the `p=7` independence criterion stays
  non-theoremic.  Boundaries preserved: no physical CKM/`Y_d`, no p=7 theorem,
  no NS/Clay promotion, and no unification promotion.

- Corrected `CKMHelicalPhaseGenerationIndexReceipt` from hypothesis-only to
  partial diagram chase:
  `partialDiagramChaseComplete_commutativityVerificationRequired`.
- Recorded the concrete 7-adic construction: `Z/3Z={1,2,4} subset F_7^x`
  generated by `2`, the three distinct characters `psi_k(2)=omega^k`, and
  `7 = 1 mod 3`, hence `omega in Z_7`.
- Recorded the module-language equivalence
  `T7(X_0(49)) tensor_Z7 Z7[Z/3Z] ~= T7(X_0(49))^3` over `Z_7`.
- Kept the promotion gates closed: physical CKM, `Y_d`, and CP phase
  derivations remain open.  The corrected convention identifies `phi` with
  the `psi2` branch because `Frob_p2 = 4 = 2^2`; branch bookkeeping alone does
  not supply the morphism skeleton or the down-type Yukawa dynamics.
- Recorded p=7 as a Structural Convergence Remark, not a theorem: uniqueness
  is verified only because no other checked prime satisfies all seven stated
  conditions, while independence remains unproved.
- Recorded the corrected OceanGate analogy only: sanding penetrated up to 15
  plies and repeated about 8 times as a periodic resonant defect; this is not
  materials or safety evidence.

# 2026-05-31 latest helical/eclipses origin tranche

- Added and wired `CKMHelicalPhaseGenerationIndexReceipt` and
  `EclipseProjectionDefectSarosRemark`.
- `CKMHelicalPhaseGenerationIndexReceipt` records the sock-knitting/spiral
  correction as a helix rather than a cylinder and gives the candidate
  `FactorVec_CKM -> T7(X0(49)) x Z/3Z` surface.  It is deliberately
  hypothesis-only in this historical entry; the correction above supersedes that
  status and records the `LogicTlurey` mod-3 phase, factor-distinction, and
  `T7(X0(49))^3` module-equivalence checks as partial over `Z_7`.
- `EclipseProjectionDefectSarosRemark` records the single-eclipse projected
  angular coincidence separately from Saros recurrence/KAM-style orbital
  stability.  It does not promote product-formula control, gravity, eclipse
  prediction, or unification.
- The origin language has been kept fail-closed across docs and receipts:
  the OceanGate sanding/resonance account is analogy only; KAM is an analogy
  around resonance stability, not an NS-flow transfer theorem.

# 2026-05-31

- Follow-on unification/frontier implementation pass: added carrier-coordinate
  receipts (`MultiPrimePAdicCarrierCoordinate`, `ProductFormulaConstraint`,
  `SectorProjectionType`), neutral operator/moonshine boundary receipts
  (`ProjectionContractionOperatorBridgeReceipt`,
  `MonstrousMoonshineSSPBoundaryReceipt`), NS tail/literature receipts
  (`TailEnergyFunctional`, `NSFlowMDLTailDominanceLemmaCandidate`,
  `NSAdelicTransferLiteratureVerdictReceipt`,
  `NSFlowMDLAdmissibilityCandidateReceipt`), CKM spurion receipts
  (`B1PSL2F7TripleV3CharacterReceipt`,
  `CKMV3SpurionTextureFrontierReceipt`,
  `PSL2F7RankOneYdTextureReceipt`), the finite cusp Hecke receipt, and the
  weave-origin remark; wired them into `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- The NS receipts now separate proved algebraic `T_r` tail monotonicity from
  the still-missing actual-NS forward estimate, and the adelic literature
  verdict records that no checked source supplies the required archimedean
  Sobolev domination theorem.
- The CKM receipts correct the `V3` spurion story: `V3^3` has one invariant in
  the exterior determinant channel, while the rank-1 heavy-generation matrix
  requires an extra residual selector and remains non-promoting.
- The finite cusp receipt records the `X_0(49)` table through `p=19` and keeps
  intrinsic Hecke gap/continuum YM/Clay promotion false.

- Paper 6 prewrite implementation pass completed.  Added the corrected NS
  carrier/Kolmogorov/Serrin receipt and the Kolmogorov-calibrated viscous-tail
  dominance receipt; both keep Clay NS promotion false and preserve the
  corrected causal chain: finite depth gives the Serrin route, unbounded depth
  only blocks that route.
- Added the corrected `PSL(2,F7)` DHR/Yukawa texture receipt.  The local
  character check confirms `chi_6=[6,2,0,0,-1,-1]`, rejects the stale
  `4A=-2` row, and records `V3 tensor V3 = V3' + V6` with no trivial
  representation.  This constrains textures only; it does not derive `Y_d`.
- Added the finite `Z/7` carrier spectral-gap receipt.  The unnormalised
  cycle gap is `2 - 2 cos(2*pi/7) ~= 0.7530203963`; the normalised
  random-walk gap is half this value.  The product carrier
  `Z/7 x Z/3 x Z/2` keeps the `Z/7` gap as bottleneck, with the corrected
  `Z/2` factor gap recorded as `2`, not `4`.  The result is tied to the
  finite CM-torsion carrier model and explicitly not transported to continuum
  YM.
- Refreshed `Docs/Paper6FinalDraftOutline.md`, `Docs/Paper6Section1Draft.md`,
  and `Docs/Paper6Section6Draft.md` around the new receipts.  Historical
  CKM diagnostic docs remain superseded unless their local banner says
  otherwise.
- Added three bounded side receipts for the writing baseline:
  `NSAdelicTransferTheoremCandidate` names the Kozyrev/Vladimirov/adelic
  product-formula transfer route but keeps the comparison unproved;
  `CKMThreeFactorBilinearLabellingNoGo` separates `Z/3`-level invariants from
  full `PSL(2,F7)` invariants; and `DHRBraidGroupOriginRemark` records the
  `B3`/Yang-Baxter/DHR-hexagon and `LogicTlurey` origin vocabulary without
  theorem promotion.

# 2026-05-30

- Manager C corrected programme-summary tranche complete.  Added
  `NSAdjacentOnlyFormalReceipt`, `NSH74RouteStatusReceipt`,
  `ProgrammeHonestSummaryReceipt`, `FinalPaperSectionTriageReceipt`, and
  `NextSessionInputRequestReceipt`; wired their imports into
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The new C receipts keep the adjacent-only
  arithmetic result, mark the H74 route as conditional/not inhabited, and
  preserve false Clay/terminal/exact-SM/CKM-final promotions.

- Manager B gauge-group closeout tranche complete locally.  Added candidate
  closeout receipts for `SU2SU3DecouplingLemmaReceipt`,
  `HeckeCircleU1YReceipt`, `U1YChargeAssignmentTableReceipt`,
  `AnomalyCancellationVerificationReceipt`,
  `GravitationalAnomalyCancellationReceipt`, and
  `SMGaugeGroupCandidatePromotionReceipt`.  The new anomaly checks use the
  all-left-handed SM Weyl convention, so `u^c`, `d^c`, `e^c`, and `nu^c`
  carry the conjugate hypercharges in the cubic and mixed anomaly sums.
- Added no-current-path and governance receipts:
  `NSVorticityNoMechanismReceipt`, `VEVAsPDGInputReceipt`,
  `CarrierDimensionfulPredictionsReceipt`,
  `Phase2BlockerMapFinalReceipt`, `NextSessionPriorityReceipt`,
  `SessionGrandSummaryReceipt`, and `FinalCommitReceipt`.  The tower now
  records NS vorticity and VEV derivation as honest blockers, with no Clay,
  exact SM, CKM, DHR/SM, or terminal promotion.
- Added Paper 6 draft sections 1-3 and Paper 8 draft sections 5-6 as prose
  sidecars.  These document the sub-percent lambda/`Vcb` diagnostic claims,
  the candidate gauge-factor origin, and the open-problem map without
  broadening the formal promotion surface.

# 2026-05-30

- Manager B final integration/validation tranche complete.  Wired
  `YukawaNormalisationStructureReceipt`,
  `CKMFullMatrixFromCarrierReceipt`, `AnomalyCancellationTableReceipt`,
  `VubFromCarrierReceipt`, `CKMDiagnosticSummaryReceipt`,
  `PhysicalCKMPromotionStatusReceipt`, `CSLevelRunningLawReceipt`,
  `YML3TightnessFromDimensionalTransmutationReceipt`,
  `YML4ContinuumLimitReceipt`, `YML5OSAxiomsForGaugeSectorReceipt`,
  `YML6WightmanReconstructionReceipt`,
  `YML7L8MassGapSurvivalReceipt`, `NSFinalStateReceipt`,
  `YMFinalStateReceipt`, `CommitAndTagFinalReceipt`, and
  `SessionEndReceipt` through `DASHI.Everything` where missing.  Indexed
  `Docs/Paper6FinalDraftOutline.md` and `Docs/Paper8FinalDraftOutline.md`
  as final-draft outline sidecars.  The CKM/Yukawa, anomaly, YM L3-L8,
  NS final-state, and commit/session protocol receipts remain diagnostic or
  governance-only: physical CKM, exact SM, DHR/SM, Wightman reconstruction,
  Clay YM, Clay NS, commit/tag/hash, and terminal promotion all remain false.
  Validation also applied one minimal Agda universe fix in
  `CKMDiagnosticSummaryReceipt`: the anomaly subreceipt field now witnesses
  `physicalCKMPromoted = false` instead of comparing a `Setω` receipt by
  builtin equality.
- After the final aggregate and promotion scans passed, the manager executed
  the Phase 2 git commit and moved the local tag `phase2-clay-roadmap-v1` to
  that commit.  The commit/tag operation is governance only and does not
  promote CKM, exact SM, Clay YM, Clay NS, or terminal claims.

- Manager C YM/NS Phase 2 tranche complete.  Added and wired corrected YM
  coupling receipts for the Heegner/charm-scale audit, QCD-running boundary,
  CS-level gauge-coupling candidate, Wilson beta from CS level, corrected
  L2 status, and the `k -> infinity` L3 tightness candidate.  The finite
  strong-coupling estimate now records `beta_SU2=3/pi`, string tension
  `2.125`, and a `2.33 GeV` finite-lattice mass-gap diagnostic, while
  continuum tightness, Wightman reconstruction, and Clay YM remain false.
- Added and wired the prime-band Littlewood-Paley NS replacement route:
  projectors, Bernstein inequality, Bony paraproduct split, Leray energy,
  Aubin-Lions compactness, nonlinear passage, weak formulation, and aggregate
  weak-solution summary.  The weak branch is inhabited at receipt scope; the
  regularity gap receipt keeps uniqueness, smoothness, BKM/vorticity control,
  and Clay NS false.
- Added `ClayNSCurrentStateReceipt` and `Phase2ProgrammeReceipt`, and updated
  roadmap/status docs.  Phase 2 is now explicitly targeted at YM
  `k`-running/tightness, NS critical Besov estimates, CKM Yukawa
  normalisation, and Paper 8 completion.  No exact SM, CKM, Clay, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

- 2026-05-30: Manager C Phase 2 programme integration completed.  Added
  `Phase2ProgrammeReceipt` and wired it through `DASHI.Everything`.  The
  receipt aggregates the visible YM L2 strong-coupling receipts, CS-level
  gauge-coupling/level-rank decoupling diagnostics, W-mass RG blocker, NS
  prime-band Littlewood-Paley replacement route, and conditional NS
  weak-solution branch.  Updated Paper 8 receipt/blocker docs, Clay YM/NS
  roadmaps, status, and devlog.  All exact SM, Clay YM, Clay NS, and terminal
  promotions remain false.

- 2026-05-30: Manager A tranche lane 6 integration/docs sidecar completed.
  Updated only `Docs/Paper8ReceiptIndex.md`,
  `Docs/Paper8UnificationBlockerMap.md`, `status.md`, and `devlog.md`.
  Added concise non-promoting entries for the corrected
  `CarrierScaleFromHeegnerReceipt`, `QCDRunningFromCarrierScaleReceipt`,
  `CarrierGaugeCouplingFromCSLevelReceipt`,
  `WilsonBetaFromCSLevelReceipt`, `YML2CorrectedStatusReceipt`,
  `YML3TightnessFromKRunningReceipt`, `CSLevelFlowFullReceipt`, and
  `WBosonMassFromCSReceipt` coupling posture; the prime-band LP branch
  through `NSAlternativeApproachSurveyReceipt`,
  `NSLittlewoodPaleyCarrierReceipt`, `PrimeBandLPDefinitionReceipt`,
  `BernsteinInequalityPrimeBandReceipt`, `ParaproductDecompositionReceipt`,
  `NSCarrierEnergyInequalityReceipt`, `NSCarrierLerayCompactnessReceipt`,
  `NSW3NonlinearPassageReceipt`, `NSW4WeakSolutionReceipt`, and
  `NSWeakSolutionSummaryReceipt`; the regularity gap through
  `NSRegularityGapReceipt`, `NSRegularityRoadmapFilledReceipt`,
  `NavierStokesRegularityTowerReceipt`, `ClayNSProofRoadmapReceipt`, and
  `EllipticBootstrapReceipt`; and `Phase2ProgrammeReceipt`.  No Agda files,
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, Clay, exact SM, CKM, or terminal promotions were
  touched.

- 2026-05-30: Worker E integrated the existing Manager B A-D
  YM/NS/deg23 follow-up tranche after the expected receipt files were visible.
  Wired YM L2 strong-coupling receipts for `beta=alpha1`, string tension,
  finite strong-coupling plaquette decay, beta-critical diagnostics, RG
  trajectory blockers, and aggregate L2 status.  Wired NS W2 receipts closing
  the pure 2/3/5 Haar-frame route by unchanged zero-mean Gram entries and
  divergent dyadic/triadic cross-scale Hilbert-Schmidt envelope, then recorded
  prime-band Littlewood-Paley/Besov/paraproduct as the replacement candidate.
  Indexed deg23 full-trace/two-loop diagnostic receipts and the Paper 8 section
  drafts for the geometric split and fermion count.  Refreshed
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, Paper 8 docs, `status.md`, and `devlog.md`; no
  Clay, CKM, exact SM, DHR/SM, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- 2026-05-30: Worker F validation/status sidecar for Manager B completed.
  Captured the pre-existing dirty worktree, waited through concurrent worker
  landings, then focused-checked the visible new Closure receipts and ran the
  full `DASHI.Everything` aggregate.  Fixed one mechanical Agda field-name
  mismatch in `ClayRoadmapAssignmentPrep`
  (`restrictedFrameLowerBoundProved` to `restrictedFrameBoundProved`).
  Validation also ran `git diff --check` and a promotion/stub scan over the
  new tranche files.  Status now records the fail-closed NS W2/frame-bound,
  finite-scope YM L1, diagnostic deg23 CM eigenvalue, and all-paper frontier
  statuses; no CKM, SM, Clay, or terminal promotion was introduced.

- 2026-05-30: Executed the first Clay-roadmap implementation tranche after
  the roadmap docs landed.  NS W2 now has receipted Gram-matrix surfaces for
  dyadic/triadic and pentadic cross terms, a negative Gershgorin route, an
  operator-norm target, a negative unrestricted-frame route via constants,
  and a restricted zero-mean/vorticity frame target.  YM L1 now has finite
  carrier-lattice Wilson-action receipts through finite reflection positivity
  and finite transfer-matrix gap, with L2 uniform correlator bounds named as
  the next target.  Deg23/T13 now records the CM-point local eigenvalue as
  zero (`a_13(E_-3)=2`, `a_13(E_-7)=0`), separating raw Hecke degree 14 from
  the still-open 2.1% residual.  `PaperStatusAllPapersReceipt` now records
  Paper 6/Paper 8 readiness as diagnostic/conjecture only and keeps both Clay
  papers false.

- 2026-05-30: Added the dedicated Clay roadmap documentation tranche.  New
  docs `Docs/ClayYMProofRoadmap.md` and `Docs/ClayNSProofRoadmap.md` decompose
  Yang-Mills into nine existence/mass-gap lemmas and Navier-Stokes into a
  conditional weak-solution branch plus a separate BKM/global-regularity
  branch.  New receipts `ClayYMProofRoadmapReceipt` and
  `ClayNSProofRoadmapReceipt` are wired through `DASHI.Everything`; they
  record the roadmap existence and keep Clay YM, Clay NS, Wightman, continuum
  YM, smooth NS, and terminal promotions false.

- 2026-05-30: Manager A T13 / deg23 residual tranche complete. Added and
  wired `Deg23FromT13HeckeReceipt`, `CMCorrectionToT13Receipt`,
  `ThirteenInertInBiquadraticReceipt`,
  `Deg23CorrectionFrom13CMReceipt`, `Deg23ResidualFinalStatusReceipt`, and
  `P13LaneHypothesisReceipt`.  The base deg23 integer is now recorded as
  `deg(T_13)=14` for inert 13 on the Hilbert modular surface over
  `Q(sqrt(21))`; the local signs are `(-3/13)=+1`, `(-7/13)=-1`,
  `(21/13)=-1`, giving two degree-2 primes in the biquadratic CM field.
  The simple CM-correction and p13 point-count routes remain negative
  diagnostics, and no Vcb/CKM/SM/DHR/Clay/terminal promotion was introduced.

- 2026-05-30: Manager C SM-count / T13 / closeout tranche complete locally.
  Added closure receipts for `T_13` as the base deg23 Hecke degree,
  SU(2)-doublet up/down splitting, the 48-Weyl count with right-handed
  neutrinos included, the final residual blocker map, worktree commit
  protocol, and next-session opening problems.  The commit receipt records
  commands only and does not stage, commit, or tag the concurrent worktree.
  The count/gauge surfaces are fail-closed: no CKM, exact SM, DHR/SM, Clay,
  or terminal promotion was introduced.

- 2026-05-30: Manager B geometric split / gauge-candidate tranche complete. Six workers added QFT receipts for conductor-level quark/lepton separation, `D=-11` isolation, D=-12 tau overlap ratios, final lepton/quark separation aggregation, p3 `SU(2)_3 -> SU(2)_1` level-flow candidate, chiral-limit `SU(3)` candidate, p3 `Z/6 -> U(1)` candidate, CS-boundary gauge-boson/EWSB candidates, and the aggregate SM gauge-group candidate map. Closure receipts now record the wavelet all-scale orthogonality failure/frame-bound blocker, exact `zeta_{Q(sqrt(21))}(-1)=1/3`, the negative deg23-from-zeta diagnostic, and the Paper 8 geometric split summary. Exact lepton/quark/Yukawa/gauge/SM/G_DHR/CKM/Clay/terminal promotions remain false.
# 2026-05-30

- Completed Manager B's T13 / gauge-decoupling / count tranche.  Added and
  wired Closure receipts for the T13 Hecke source of deg23, the local CM
  splitting/correction diagnostics at 13, the p13 negative point-count
  diagnostic, SU(2)-doublet up/down splitting, the 48-Weyl count check,
  the final residual blocker map, and next-session opening problems.
- Added and wired QFT receipts for the CS-three-lane gauge candidate map,
  level-rank decoupling candidate, naive W-boson mass failure, lepton-Yukawa
  overlap hierarchy, no-fourth-generation Heegner-exhaustion candidate, and
  QFT fermion-count blocker surface.
- The tranche separates the now-receipted base `deg23=14` from the still-open
  `14 -> 14.302` residual, and records the gauge/count improvements as
  structural or candidate-only.  No CKM, exact SM, DHR/SM, Clay, or terminal
  promotion was introduced.

# 2026-05-30

- Implemented the Paper 8 introduction draft and receipt hook.  Added
  `Docs/Paper8IntroductionDraft.md` and
  `Paper8IntroductionDraftReceipt`, then wired the receipt through
  `DASHI.Everything` and `Docs/Paper8ReceiptIndex.md`.  The introduction
  frames DASHI as a fail-closed programme, summarizes the bounded lambda,
  diagnostic `A`, charge-quantisation, and first-six Heegner matter-lane
  results, and keeps gauge-group origin, quark-lepton separation, and
  no-fourth-generation as candidate/blocker lanes.  No Clay, full SM,
  accepted-new-physics, or terminal promotion is asserted.

- Completed Manager C's geometric split / zeta / wavelet revision tranche.
  Added `ZetaQ21MinusOneReceipt`, `Deg23FromZetaK21Receipt`,
  `AggregateAndCommitReceipt`, and `GeometricSplitSummaryReceipt`, and wired
  the existing dyadic/triadic orthogonality and wavelet-frame revision
  receipts into `DASHI.Everything`.
- The exact `Q(sqrt(21))` value is now exposed as
  `zeta_Q(sqrt(21))(-1)=1/3`, while the tested Hilbert-volume and
  carrier-natural normalisations remain negative for the `14.302` deg23
  target.
- The wavelet shortcut is closed negatively: all-scale mutual orthogonality is
  false because coarser-scale cross terms can be nonzero, so the NS bridge
  remains blocked on a genuine frame-bound / Gram-spectrum argument.
- The Paper 8 geometric split summary records the pairwise-coprime quark
  levels `3,4,7`, lepton overlap factors `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, and the
  `D=-11` isolation exception.  These are diagnostic/candidate surfaces only;
  no CKM, SM, DHR/SM, Clay, or terminal promotions were introduced.
- Refreshed the sidecar publication-control docs for these Manager C receipts:
  Paper 8 and cross-paper indexes now distinguish exact zeta arithmetic,
  negative deg23 normalisation diagnostics, the geometric split summary, and
  aggregate/commit governance without claiming staging, commit, tag, SM,
  Clay, or terminal promotion.

- Completed Manager A's geometric quark/lepton split tranche.  Implemented
  six Closure receipts:
  `QuarkLeptonGeometricSplitReceipt`, `Disc11ExceptionReceipt`,
  `LeptonYukawaFromLevelOverlapReceipt`,
  `MuonNeutrinoIsolationReceipt`, `TauLeptonGen3OverlapReceipt`, and
  `LeptonQuarkSeparationFinalReceipt`.
- The final receipt aggregates the new Manager-A surfaces and retires the
  unit-group-only criterion.  It records pairwise-coprime quark levels
  `3,4,7`, D=-8 level-overlap ratio `1/2`, D=-12 overlap ratios `1/3` and
  `1/4`, and D=-11 leading direct quark-lepton Yukawa zero.  These are
  diagnostic structural claims only; all lepton-sector, exact SM, DHR/SM,
  CKM, and Clay flags remain false.
- Updated `LeptonSectorGapReceipt` audit text and wired the new receipts into
  `DASHI.Everything`.

- Completed Manager C's Hilbert modular volume / wavelet proof /
  session-closeout tranche.  Implemented
  `WaveletOrthogonalityGeneralArgumentReceipt` as a candidate
  equidistribution/partition route, leaving all-scale wavelet orthogonality,
  frame bounds, and Clay NS false.  Implemented `ZetaK21ComputationReceipt`
  with the exact finite Bernoulli-character value
  `zeta_Q(sqrt(21))(-1)=1/3`, then updated `NSDeg23ConnectionReceipt` so the
  zeta route is a negative deg23 diagnostic rather than a missing dependency.
  Added `Phase1FinalStateReceipt`, `WorktreeCleanupReceipt`, and
  `SessionEndProtocolReceipt` as governance-only closeout surfaces; none
  stage, commit, tag, or promote terminal claims.  Wired the receipts into
  `DASHI.Everything`.

# 2026-05-30

- Completed Manager B's Heegner-ordering / SM-content tranche as six
  fail-closed QFT receipts: `HeegnerOrderingPrincipleReceipt`,
  `CSLevelFlowFullReceipt`, `SU3ColourFrom3LanesFusionReceipt`,
  `HyperchargeNormalisationAnomalyReceipt`,
  `ColourFromNcThreeLanesReceipt`, and `SMContentSummaryReceipt`.
- The new receipts record the first-six Heegner-discriminant matter-lane
  hypothesis, full CS level-flow candidate map, finite `N_c=3` colour
  diagnostic, standard left-handed Weyl anomaly-cancellation ledger, and
  aggregate SM-content map.  They deliberately do not derive continuous
  `U1_Y`, exact `SU3_c`, exact `SU2_L`, lepton-sector construction, physical
  CKM, no-fourth-generation exclusion, exact SM reconstruction, or
  `G_DHR ~= G_SM`.
- Wired the receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed the
  cross-paper/Paper 8 receipt indexes plus Gate 6 blocker map.  All terminal
  and physical promotion flags remain false.

- Implemented Manager A's Hilbert-volume / Vub-NLO / Heegner-position
  follow-up receipts: `HilbertModularVolumeReceipt`,
  `Deg23HilbertModularCandidateReceipt`, `VubNLOFromCarrierRGReceipt`,
  `HeegnerSequenceQuarkLeptonReceipt`, and
  `CKMHierarchyFromHeegnerPositionReceipt`.
- Recorded `zeta_{Q(sqrt(21))}(-1)=1/3` as exact Hilbert-route input, kept
  `deg23` underived after the bounded normalisation sweep, and marked the
  degree-28 NLO `|Vub|` correction as requiring separate QCD running rather
  than FactorVec RG.
- Added `Docs/Paper6StatusAfterPhase1.md`.  The Heegner-position
  quark/lepton split remains candidate-only, and the naive positional-gap
  `|Vub|` model is now a negative diagnostic.  No terminal promotions were
  introduced.

- Completed Manager B's SU(2) level-shift and lepton-lane correction tranche.
  Added and wired `SU2LevelMismatchResolutionReceipt`,
  `FermionicLoopCSShiftReceipt`, `D11D12LeptonLanesReceipt`,
  `LeptonGenerationMappingReceipt`, `QuarkLeptonCMUnitGroupReceipt`, and
  `ConductorVsDiscriminantReceipt`.
- Corrected the older lepton-gap surface: `D=-8` is a maximal-order row with
  order conductor `1` and modular/character level `8`, not a conductor-4 p2
  collision.  The new unit-group receipt records the negative diagnostic that
  `Z/2` units alone cannot distinguish quark from lepton lanes because the
  active `D=-7` p5 lane also has `Z/2`.
- The p3 `SU(2)_3 -> SU(2)_1` route is now recorded as a conditional
  Chern-Simons/fermionic-loop shift candidate only.  Exact weak `SU(2)_L`,
  lepton-sector construction, quark/lepton separation, exact SM
  reconstruction, and `G_DHR ~= G_SM` remain false.

- Implemented Manager C's Phase 1 wavelet/abstract closeout receipts:
  `DyadicTriadicScale1InnerProduct`,
  `MutualOrthogonalityGeneralProofReceipt`,
  `NSFrameBoundImplicationReceipt`, `Phase1CommitReceipt`,
  `Paper8AbstractDraftReceipt`, and `NextSessionPriorityReceipt`.
- Corrected the wavelet diagnostic layer: the prior scale-one `sqrt(6)/6`
  result is retired for the stated supported-Haar convention, with the direct
  computation recorded as `sqrt(6)*(1/9-1/9)=0`.  The all-scale 2/3/5
  orthogonality/frame theorem remains open; no NS promotion follows.
- Added `Docs/Paper8AbstractDraft.md`, refreshed the Paper 8 receipt index,
  blocker map, and submission checklist, and kept the Phase 1 commit/tag as a
  draft only.

- Implemented Manager A's deg23/Vub/lepton-lane diagnostic tranche:
  `HeckeCorrOnX021Receipt`, `Deg23DirectIsogenyReceipt`,
  `Deg23ShimuraApproachReceipt`, `Vub28IsogenyReceipt`,
  `D8LeptonLaneReceipt`, and `LeptonQuarkSeparationReceipt`.
- Wired the six receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda`.  The key changes are
  fail-closed: `X_0(21)` is rejected as the deg23 Heegner surface, the old
  `deg23=14` point-count sum is marked underived, the Hilbert/Shimura surface
  route is named but blocked, the degree-28 `|Vub|` route remains an NLO-QCD
  hypothesis, and `D=-8` is only a lepton-lane candidate.  No CKM, Vub,
  lepton-sector, SM, YM, or NS promotion was added.

- Implemented Manager C's wavelet/Paper8 closeout receipts:
  `HaarMutualCoherenceReceipt`, `WaveletOrthogonalityProofReceipt`,
  `NSWeakSolutionFinalReceipt`, `Paper8CoreThesisReceipt`,
  `CommitTagPreparationReceipt`, and `ResidualBlockersSummaryReceipt`.
- Wired the six receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed the Paper 8
  receipt index plus blocker map.  The subsequent follow-up receipt retires
  the `sqrt(6)/6` scale-one diagnostic for the stated supported-Haar
  convention; the multibase wavelet bridge still proceeds through frame/Gram
  bounds.
- `CommitTagPreparationReceipt` prepares the `heegner-ckm-v2-diagnostic`
  message without creating a tag.  All terminal and physical promotions remain
  false.

# 2026-05-29 pre-submission freeze

- Completed Manager B's SU(2) level / charge-normalisation / lepton-gap
  tranche as six fail-closed QFT receipts.  `SU2Level4Spin1RepReceipt`
  separates the ordinary WZW/KZ `SU(2)_4` weight convention from the alternate
  half-spin diagnostic; `Spin2FermionInterpretationReceipt` records the
  five-dimensional/non-doublet mismatch; `KacMoodyLevelReceipt` names the
  `SU(2)_1` versus p3 `SU(2)_3` weak-level gap; `ChargeNormalisationReceipt`
  separates the carrier-derived `1/6` hypercharge unit from exact
  normalisation and anomaly cancellation; `LeptonSectorGapReceipt` records the
  next Heegner candidate window; and `FourthLaneHypothesisReceipt` records the
  p11 fourth-lane hierarchy contradiction.
- Wired the six receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed the
  cross-paper receipt index, Paper 8 receipt index, and Gate 6 blocker map.
  The tranche keeps physical fermions, exact `U1_Y`, exact `SU3_c`, lepton
  sector, fourth generation, exact `G_DHR ~= G_SM`, and full SM reconstruction
  false.

- Implemented Manager C's golden-ratio / wavelet-frame / scalar-OS tranche.
  New receipts:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GoldenRatioNumericsReceipt.agda`,
  `RogersRamanujanP5Receipt.agda`, `HaarFrameBoundsReceipt.agda`,
  `ScalarOSTransferMatrixReceipt.agda`, `CarrierHiggsMassReceipt.agda`, and
  `GoldenRatioUnifyingReceipt.agda`.
- Wired the receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed the Paper 8
  receipt index, blocker map, and submission checklist.  The tranche keeps all
  CKM, Higgs, NS, YM, Clay, SM, and terminal promotions false: phi is recorded
  as an open diagnostic pattern, not as a derived carrier theorem.

- Completed Manager B's conductor/charge-quantisation tranche as six
  fail-closed QFT receipts.  `SU2kCSSpinStatisticsReceipt` records the
  `h=C2/(2k)` diagnostic, including the negative fundamental-rep cases and
  the conditional spin-1/k=4 half-spin case; `SU2Level4CarrierReceipt` records
  p2 conductor 4 as an `SU(2)_4` candidate; `LevelRankDualityReceipt` records
  strict level-rank authority while keeping the requested `SU(2)_3/SU(3)_1`
  relation candidate-only; `ConductorLevelCorrespondenceReceipt` records the
  `4/3/7` conductor table; `U1YFromConductorReceipt` records SM hypercharges
  as p3-lane `Z/6` signed-sixth characters; and
  `SMChargeQuantisationReceipt` aggregates finite p3-lane charge
  quantisation.
- Wired the six receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed the
  cross-paper receipt index, Paper 8 receipt index, and Gate 6 blocker map.
  Structural charge quantisation is now inhabited as finite/candidate data,
  while exact `U1_Y`, exact `SU3_c`, exact `G_DHR ~= G_SM`, and full SM
  reconstruction remain false.

- Implemented Manager C's RG/OS/NS bridge refinement receipts:
  `FactorVecAverageVsSumReceipt`, `RGOperatorNormFormalProof`,
  `HaarWaveletEmbeddingReceipt`, `MultiBaseWaveletCompactnessReceipt`,
  `OSPositivityCorrectObjectReceipt`, and `ClayBlockerUpdateReceipt`.
- Wired them into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed Paper 8 draft/index,
  blocker map, cross-paper receipt index, submission checklist, and final
  governance scan.  The tranche records normalized-average RG contraction and
  finite scalar-sector OS positivity without promoting parent-sum RG,
  continuum RG, full OS/Wightman, Archimedean NS compactness, BKM smoothness,
  or either Clay problem.

- Completed Manager B's Clifford/anyon/SU3 boundary tranche as fail-closed
  receipts.  `CliffordFromP2LaneReceipt` records the p2-lane
  `F4 -> M2(F2)` companion-matrix Clifford candidate; `SpinorRepresentationReceipt`
  records the characteristic-2 obstruction to a fermion sign;
  `CliffordCharZeroLiftReceipt` records the characteristic-zero anyonic phase
  `exp(2*pi*i/3)`; `AnyonicSectorPhysicsReceipt` reframes the prime lanes as
  a `2+1D` anyonic diagnostic; `SU3FromAnyon3FoldReceipt` records the
  conditional `SU3_1` Chern-Simons candidate; and `BulkBoundarySU3Receipt`
  records the holographic/bulk-boundary colour route as conditional.
- Wired the six new QFT receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed
  the cross-paper/Paper 8 receipt indexes plus the Gate 6 blocker map.  The
  tranche keeps physical `3+1D` fermion derivation, continuous `SU3_c`,
  exact `G_DHR ~= G_SM`, and full SM reconstruction false.

- Implemented Manager C vacuum/VEV/Clay blocker-map receipts:
  `VacuumSectorReceipt`, `MassiveSubspaceOSPositivity`, `CarrierVEVReceipt`,
  `RGScaleVsCarrierScaleReceipt`, `OSAxiomsContinuumStatus`, and
  `ClayBothBlockerMapReceipt`.
- Recorded the negative massive-subspace diagnostic: separating the physical
  vacuum and projecting the p2 zero mode does not make the bare p3/p5 block
  PSD.  Bare Yukawa constants are now explicitly blocked from being read as
  physical Hamiltonian entries without a VEV-calibrated mass matrix.
- Updated `DASHI/Everything.agda`, Paper 8 draft/index/checklist, the blocker
  map, cross-paper receipt index, and final governance scan for the new
  fail-closed frontier map.

- Completed Manager B's SU3/U1Y blocker tranche as fail-closed receipts.
  `ColourFromPrimeLaneExtensionReceipt` records the finite p2/p3/p5 `S3`
  permutation diagnostic; `TrialitySymmetryReceipt` records the lcm-12
  diagonal CRT action and rejects full triality/SU3 promotion;
  `GluonSectorFromDepth2Receipt` records the negative depth-2 count
  `55 != 8`; `U1YFromCMCharacterReceipt` records the finite `Z/3` inside `Z/6`
  hypercharge candidate; `SM3FoldSymmetryReceipt` aggregates the current
  `SU2_L`/`U1_Y`/`SU3_c` candidate map; and
  `NonabelianGapNarrowedReceipt` states the three remaining mathematical
  questions precisely.
- Wired the six new QFT receipts into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and refreshed
  the cross-paper/Paper 8 receipt indexes plus the Gate 6 blocker map.  The
  tranche keeps continuous `SU3_c`, continuous `U1_Y`, carrier-derived spin,
  arbitrary DHR closure, exact `G_DHR ~= G_SM`, and full SM reconstruction
  false.

- Implemented Manager C H0/RG/Wightman/NS continuum receipts:
  `H0ExplicitMatrixReceipt`, `H0SignConventionReceipt`,
  `NormalisedH0OSPositivity`, `RGContractionExplicitReceipt`,
  `WightmanReconstructionCandidateReceipt`, and
  `NSCarrierContinuumLimitReceipt`.
- Recorded the finite H0 result honestly: the requested raw matrix with all
  three couplings is not PSD because all principal `2x2` minors are negative.
  The OS-positive branch now requires a normalized or inverted transfer
  operator and remains open.
- Updated `DASHI/Everything.agda`, Paper 8 draft/index/checklist, the blocker
  map, cross-paper receipt index, and final governance scan.  Focused Agda
  checks passed for all six new modules.

- Completed Manager B's DHR nonabelian-route tranche as fail-closed receipts.
  `ConformalSpinFromCMReceipt` records the negative CM conformal-spin
  diagnostic (`h=1,3/4,7/4`, not direct spin-1/2 quark fields);
  `SpinStatisticsConnectionReceipt` records that a separate Dirac spin sector
  is required; `DiracSpinSectorReceipt` records `rho_spin` as a conditional
  CAR-labelled candidate; `TensorProductWithSpinReceipt` records conditional
  fermionic quark sectors; `NonAbelianFusionFromSpin` records the conditional
  Clebsch-Gordan/`Rep(SU2)` nonabelian route; and
  `GaugeSectorFromSpinCMTensor` records the conditional compact-group candidate
  `(Z/4 x Z/6 x Z/2) x SU2`.
- Kept the honest blockers explicit: no carrier-derived spin sector, no full
  DHR localization/transportability for the spin tensor product, no `SU3_c`, no
  `U1_Y`, and no exact `G_DHR ~= G_SM` promotion.

- Worker B6 added
  `DASHI.Physics.QFT.GaugeSectorFromSpinCMTensor`, a conditional candidate
  surface for `C_phys = C_CM boxtimes Rep(SU2)`.  The canonical receipt records
  `G_DHR,phys candidate = (Z/4 x Z/6 x Z/2) x SU2`, threads the existing finite
  abelian DHR receipt and conditional DHR/SM promotion receipt, and marks
  `su2LFromSpinSector = true` only conditionally.
- The same receipt keeps `su3cGapIdentified`, `u1yFromZ4Candidate`, and exact
  SM reconstruction false/open; no full DR compact-group reconstruction or
  `G_DHR ~= G_SM` promotion was introduced.  The module is imported by
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.

- Added Manager C frontier split receipts and kept them fail-closed:
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NavierStokesBound3TimeDerivativeReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AubinLionsBound3Full`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UltrametricAubinLionsCompactness`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.EllipticBootstrapReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.RGOperatorNormReceipt`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.RGBanachFixedPointReceipt`, and
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.OSPositivityFromRGFixedPoint`.
- Updated `DASHI/Everything.agda`, Paper 8 draft/index/checklist, the blocker
  map, cross-paper receipt index, final claim governance scan, and project
  memory to cite those receipts.  The added receipts refine the Clay-facing
  frontier but do not promote any Clay or continuum claim.

- Manager B completed the DHR tensor-fusion/reconstruction-boundary tranche.
  `FinitePrimeLaneTensorFusionReceipts` now threads finite CM-character
  enrichments for p2⊗p3 (`Z/4 x Z/6 = 24`), p2⊗p5 (`Z/4 x Z/2 = 8` with the
  corrected p5 Heegner lane), and p3⊗p5 (`Z/6 x Z/2 = 12`).  The receipt keeps
  arbitrary tensor closure, full representation ring, and nonabelian SM
  reconstruction false.
- Added `FibreFunctorFaithfulnessReceipt`,
  `FiniteDHRAbelianReconstructionReceipt`, and
  `ArbitrarySectorExtensionReceipt`.  These record finite object separation,
  the finite abelian `Z/4 x Z/6 x Z/2` character surface, and the exact
  nonabelian/arbitrary-sector gap while preserving `gDHREqualsGSMPromoted =
  false`.

- Worker 5 docs pass recorded Phase 1 target status across the assigned
  governance surfaces.  The tracked set is eight receipts:
  `RGContractionReceipt`, `UltrametricAubinLionsReceipt`,
  `FinitePrimeLaneDHRSMCompatibilityLedger`,
  `FinitePrimeLaneConjugateDualReceipts`, `ArbitrarySectorClosureReceipt`,
  `G12FromDHRSectorsReceipt`,
  `PenguinDecayCarrierDerivedC9ConstraintTargetReceipt`, and
  `KroneckerLimitAlphaCorrectionReceipt`.
- Tightened the Gate 7 Cabibbo diagnostic after the active-formula correction.
  `G12FromDHRSectorsReceipt` records `alpha1 = sqrt(m_u/m_c)` at the recorded
  precision.  The old `alpha1 * g12` parametrisation and the later down-sector
  `sqrt((alpha1^2 * m_c + delta) / m_s)` route are legacy diagnostics, not the
  active path.  The active formula is
  `|V_us| = pi*sqrt(3)*sqrt(m_u/m_c)`. `U1CMOrbitIntegralReceipt` now derives the X0(4) sector normalization;
  `cabibboAngleDerived` and `matchesPDG` remain false.
- Preserved the false boundaries: finite p2p3/p2p5/p3p5 tensor fusion is
  computed, but arbitrary tensor closure remains false; NS Aubin-Lions/smooth
  convergence is still open; FactorVec RG contraction/fixed-point construction
  is still open; and no unsafe promotion was introduced.
- Added the reproducible numerical check
  `scripts/check_g12_isogeny_normalization.py` and its report
  `Docs/G12IsogenyNormalizationDiagnostic.md`.  Paper 6, Paper 8, the receipt
  indexes, blocker map, submission checklist, and governance scan now cite the
  diagnostic and the updated proof split: X0(4) sector normalization is
  derived, while physical CKM diagonalisation and PDG authority binding remain
  open.

- Implemented the requested flag-flip mathematics as fail-closed receipt
  surfaces rather than as overclaims:
  - `RGContractionReceipt` names the FactorVec RG contraction/Banach fixed
    point/positive spectral-gap route for Yang-Mills, with operator-norm,
    contraction, fixed-point, strong-resolvent, and Clay flags false.
  - `UltrametricAubinLionsReceipt` packages the NS Leray/Sobolev/time-derivative
    three-bound route, with compactness, smooth limit, continuum NS
    preservation, BKM passage, and Clay flags false.
  - `ArbitrarySectorClosureReceipt` names direct-sum/tensor/conjugate/full
    fibre-functor/SM representation-ring blockers after the conditional DHR
    authority receipt.
  - `G12FromDHRSectorsReceipt` records that the naive finite-field overlap is
    zero and that the p2-p3 normalization is supplied by the X0(4) modular-volume bridge while full Cabibbo/CKM promotion remains false.
  - `KroneckerLimitAlphaCorrectionReceipt` records the Kronecker-limit
    correction target for the alpha1 near-hit while keeping modular-alpha
    derivation false.
- Focused Agda checks passed for the new receipt modules before the aggregate
  validation pass; the docs track the full eight-receipt Phase 1 target set.

- Completed the final manager freeze pass for the Paper 8 / Paper 1
  pre-submission state.  Added `Docs/PreSubmissionFreeze2026-05-29.md` as the
  local freeze record with validation commands, forbidden-claim scan results,
  and the non-arXiv submission boundary.
- Rechecked the five forbidden overclaim classes: conditional DHR authority as
  full `G_DHR ~= G_SM`, finite OS positivity as Clay closure,
  `yukawaSuppressPatternConsistent` as Cabibbo derivation, Monster depth bound
  as proved, and alpha as derived from modular geometry.  Live positive claims
  remain clean; examples and receipt boundaries are intentionally negative.
- Added a reproducible exploratory CM `j`-invariant scan:
  `scripts/cm_j_alpha_scan.py`, frozen output
  `scripts/data/cm_j_alpha_scan_2026-05-29.json`, and
  `Docs/CMJAlphaDiagnosticScan.md`.  The scan verifies `j(i)=1728` and
  `j(rho)=0` numerically and records nearby naive-normalization matches while
  preserving all modular-alpha derivation flags as false.  The follow-on
  `scripts/check_alpha_from_j_values.py` / `Docs/AlphaFromJNumericalCheck.md`
  result is sharper: `72 / |j(i)-j(rho)| = 72/1728 = 1/24` is an `alpha1`
  near-hit with `1.024%` discrepancy and `match=true`; `72 = 3*24` is a modularly
  meaningful signal, but the correction is unidentified and `alpha2` remains
  a no-hit.
- Refreshed Gate 5 hash governance in the cross-paper index and audits:
  CMS archive `561babac...`, CMS `Results.yaml` `08a244d1...`,
  `ins1486676` record JSON `94a6bb5a...`, `ins1486676` Table 3
  `d05fbdf6...`, and P5' table `8ee74f4e...` are verified artifact bindings
  only, not accepted residual or new-physics promotion.
- Validation passed for `git diff --check`, the focused Clay/YM/NS/Moonshine
  Agda checks, full `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and the CM-alpha diagnostic
  script.

# 2026-05-29 Manager governance tightening / Paper 8 pre-submission

- Added a governance note for the next Paper 8 pass: keep the tower theorem and
  closure route separate.  The paper may present the inhabited shared
  Millennium tower schema and instance receipts, but closure language must stay
  behind the explicit hard-target blockers and false promotion receipts.
- Required the Gate 3 paragraph to be visible rather than implicit: YM
  finite-boundary evidence belongs to the finite/local receipt lane; strict
  nonabelian YM, Hodge/variation/IBP, OS/Wightman, and continuum Clay promotion
  remain outside the tower result.
- Recorded the requested `UnificationClaim` reading-ladder discipline: route
  readers through claim-governance/readiness surfaces before stronger theorem
  owners, so bridge wording cannot be read as full unification.
- Validation passed after manager integration: touched-doc `git diff --check`,
  focused Agda checks for the Paper 8 tower/YM spine, and the full aggregate
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`.

# 2026-05-29 Manager C Clay closure hard-target receipt

- Implemented `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ClayMillenniumClosureTargetReceipt`.
  The receipt packages two exact hard-target surfaces:
  `CarrierOSPositivityAndWightmanTargetReceipt` for Yang-Mills and
  `CarrierBKMControlTargetReceipt` for Navier-Stokes.
- YM closure is now typed as requiring carrier OS positivity, a uniform
  depth-independent positive mass gap, an interacting continuum Yang-Mills
  construction, Wightman reconstruction, and Clay authority.  The canonical
  receipt records the candidate formula `Delta_d >= c * alpha_1^d` only as a
  target and keeps all closure flags false.
- NS closure is now typed as requiring uniform carrier enstrophy control,
  uniform `L^\infty` BKM vorticity control on finite horizons, continuum BKM
  passage, and Clay authority.  The canonical receipt consumes the finite NS
  tower but keeps all continuum/Clay closure flags false.
- Wired the targets into the split Millennium tower instances and aggregate:
  `MillenniumTowerYangMillsInstanceReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerNavierStokesInstanceReceipt`, and `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- Updated publication-control docs so Paper 8 points at the new typed blockers:
  `Docs/Paper8UnificationDraft.md`,
  `Docs/Paper8UnificationBlockerMap.md`, `Docs/Paper8ReceiptIndex.md`,
  `Docs/Paper8ClaimGovernanceAudit.md`, `Docs/CrossPaperReceiptIndex.md`, and
  `Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md`.  `Docs/Paper3YangMillsGeometryDraft.md` now
  also cites the OS/Wightman target as the exact Yang-Mills closing boundary.
- Validation passed for the new receipt, both split tower instances,
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and diff whitespace checks on touched files.

# 2026-05-29 Manager C Gate 5 citation authority / papers tranche

- Coordinated six workers for the requested Manager C tranche: Gate 5 authority
  typing, Papers 2-4, Papers 5-7, 15SSP/Paper 1 verification, cross-paper
  indexes/checklists, and Gate 5 hash verification.
- Added/validated `DASHI.Core.AuthorityBoundary` and wired the LHCb
  `B_s -> mu mu` lane as `CitationAuthority` rather than `ArtifactAuthority`.
  The CERN repository citation is bound; HEPData absence and no-artifact status
  are typed facts; empirical and non-SM promotion remain false.
- Worker docs expanded Paper 2, Paper 3, Paper 4, Paper 5, Paper 6, and Paper 7
  into honest receipt-bounded drafts, and added cross-paper readiness/checklist
  surfaces.
- Validation passed:
  `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`
  and `git diff --check` on the touched tranche files.
- Did not create `gate5-lhcb-closed-citation-authority` because the worktree is
  intentionally dirty with concurrent uncommitted manager/worker changes; an
  annotated tag on current `HEAD` would omit this tranche.

# 2026-05-29 Paper 1 15SSP bridge update

- Added `DASHI.Physics.Moonshine.SupersingularPrimeLaneBridge` as the formal
  DASHI-to-15-supersingular-prime bridge receipt.  It binds the tracked lane
  set to `P_SS = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71}`, records Ogg
  condition (2), supersingular field-completeness over `F_p`, as the
  DASHI-natural characterization, and keeps `primeSetForcedFromFirstPrinciples`,
  `oggOriginalQuestionResolved`, `standardModelGaugeGroupDerived`, and terminal
  promotion false.
- Wired the new Moonshine receipt into `DASHI/Everything.agda` and updated
  Paper 1 TeX/Markdown plus bibliography/receipt index to cite Ogg 1975 and
  Borcherds 1992 as external authority boundaries.
- Validation passed for the focused new receipt, the aggregate
  `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library
  DASHI/Everything.agda`, `git diff --check`, and a Paper 1 `latexmk` build.

# 2026-05-29 Paper 1 / YM authority hygiene audit

- Audited the repo for the disputed withdrawn 5D Yang-Mills arXiv identifier,
  unverified `B_s -> mu mu` residual-number wording, and recent local PDF/arXiv authority
  candidates.
- Kept the withdrawn 5D YM route only as a generic non-promoting route-audit
  class and removed the exact identifier/DOI strings from DASHI-facing files.
- Replaced the hard-coded unverified penguin residual-number conditional with an
  artifact-bound sub-2-sigma conditional theorem shape.  Canonical Gate 5
  `acceptedResidualCandidate`, selected-thread LHCb checksum authority, and
  empirical promotion remain false unless the stated artifacts and authority
  prerequisites are supplied.
- Verified local recent artifacts: `rspa.2025.0912.pdf` is the Gate 4
  Friedmann-instability authority boundary; `2504.18131v1.pdf` is unrelated
  digital forensics; the Clay Jaffe-Witten PDF remains only a problem-statement
  boundary.
- Validation passed: focused Agda checks for the touched YM and penguin modules,
  `ContinuumClayMassGapReceiptObligation`, `YangMillsMassGapBoundary`,
  `timeout 300s ... DASHI/Everything.agda`, and `git diff --check`.

# 2026-05-29 Manager A Paper 8/unification tranche

- Implemented the Paper 8 formal spine and publication package as a
  fail-closed unification architecture, not a completed-unification claim.
- Added/validated the shared Millennium tower schema and lane-instance receipts:
  `MillenniumTowerSchemaReceipt`, `MillenniumTowerInstancesReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerYangMillsInstanceReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerNavierStokesInstanceReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerGRInstanceReceipt`, and
  `MillenniumTowerDHRSMInstanceReceipt`.
- Added/validated `CabibboAngleCarrierReceipt` to preserve the alpha/Yukawa
  diagnostic and Cabibbo target form while keeping accepted common alpha,
  physical CKM, and Cabibbo derivation false.
- Wrote `Docs/Paper8UnificationDraft.md` as a full manuscript draft and added
  the Paper 8 blocker map, receipt index, claim-governance audit, submission
  checklist, and PlantUML unification map.
- Validation:
  - focused Agda checks passed for each new receipt module;
  - `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda` passed;
  - `git diff --check` passed on the touched Paper 8/receipt files.

# 2026-05-29 Manager B integration sidecar

- Wired the landed Manager B formal-spine modules into `DASHI/Everything.agda`:
  `MillenniumTowerSchemaReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerYangMillsInstanceReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerNavierStokesInstanceReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerInstancesReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerGRInstanceReceipt`,
  `MillenniumTowerDHRSMInstanceReceipt`, and
  `CabibboAngleCarrierReceipt`.
- Recorded the tranche state without promotion: GR/Friedmann are authority
  boundaries, Stone/GNS/Hilbert remains finite or quotient-level with physical
  Hilbert colimit open, cross-gate Hamiltonian compatibility is interface
  bookkeeping rather than a common physical Hamiltonian theorem, and the
  Millennium tower schema/instances keep continuum discharge, Clay acceptance,
  GR/cosmology promotion, terminal promotion, full `G_DHR ~= G_SM`, and full
  unification false.  The Cabibbo receipt records the alpha/Yukawa suppression
  pattern and `theta_C = arcsin(alpha1 * g12)` target while keeping
  common-alpha, Cabibbo derivation, `g12`, arcsin error-bound, and physical
  CKM promotion false.
- Validation passed for the focused Manager B receipt set and for
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` with the standard local Agda command.

# 2026-05-29 Gate 4 Temple/Friedmann instability receipt

- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FriedmannInstabilitySaddleReceipt.agda` and
  imported it from `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- Bound the downloaded Proc. R. Soc. A PDF
  `/home/c/Downloads/rspa.2025.0912.pdf` with SHA256
  `a105917e23d118c6c41004292c2ecb2a32f042dec738ccd2c380253e0eace6cf`.
- The new receipt records Alexander, Temple, and Vogler 2026,
  `10.1098/rspa.2025.0912`, as a fail-closed external authority for the
  Einstein-Euler self-similar Friedmann saddle/instability statement.  It
  consumes the contracted-Bianchi matter closure and Wald GR authority receipts
  while keeping dark-energy removal, LCDM falsification, carrier `xi = r/t`
  identification, and cosmology promotion false.
- Focused Agda check passed for
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FriedmannInstabilitySaddleReceipt.agda`.

# 2026-05-29 Manager A paper/package follow-up

- Completed the Manager A Paper 1/Paper 2/Paper 8 follow-up.  The arXiv web
  submission itself was not attempted because final upload, preview approval,
  license choice, author identity confirmation, and submitter certification
  require an authenticated arXiv account session.
- Prepared
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/build/paper1-submission-candidate-arxiv-source.tar.gz`
  as a flattened source archive for Paper 1.  SHA256:
  `b1092ebf4c68d7dd0547ee92102e0da07ff4abcd2edf2d0209c4cc79ce547573`.
  Clean extraction build from `/tmp/dashi-paper1-arxiv-test` passes with
  `latexmk`, producing a 31-page PDF with SHA256
  `bf70ab306b565b2086b9dffc5d07404535e3c2e9a6871cfb325343aceed73e48`.
- Added/updated
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ArxivSubmissionChecklist.md` and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ArxivSubmissionMetadata.md` with title,
  author string, abstract, comments, package manifest, `math-ph` primary
  recommendation, optional `hep-th` cross-list guidance, and the external
  account-authenticated upload boundary.
- Added `Docs/Paper2GRGeometryDraft.md` and
  `Docs/Paper2GRGeometryRoadmap.md` for Paper 2, covering DCHoTT B0 bridge
  obligations, finite Lorentzian carrier geometry, sourced-Einstein/Wald
  authority boundary, continuum Levi-Civita fail-closed boundary, and Paper 3
  non-flat GR blockers.
- Added `Docs/Paper8NSMillenniumSkeleton.md`, framing the NS/YM
  structural-isomorphism paper as a formal-methods contribution rather than a
  Millennium proof.

# 2026-05-29 Gate 7 alpha/Yukawa/Vus memory update

- Updated project memory for the landed Gate 7 target surfaces without
  promotion.  The alpha receipt records finite mass-ratio readback estimates
  `0.041240` and `0.085720`, but keeps alpha agreement, accepted target,
  supplied bound, and physical promotion false.
- Recorded the off-diagonal Yukawa state as carrier-only: y12/y13/y23 are
  symbolic inter-lane/depth-suppressed carrier entries, with physical values,
  physical coupling scale, DHR physical matrices, and CKM promotion still
  absent.
- Recorded the Vus target state as comparison-only: current carrier Vus is
  identity-zero, PDG-sized `0.225` is only a target datum, and physical CKM /
  exact PDG match claims remain false.

# 2026-05-29 Gate 6 DHR authority/Tannaka memory update

- Recorded the final honest state of the Manager B DHR authority/Tannaka lane.
  Finite p2/p3/p5 prime-lane axiom/naturality evidence is inhabited at the
  carrier-receipt level, and the DR reconstruction authority receipt consumes
  the five DHR/DR axiom receipt pack.
- `DHROriginalPaperAuthorityReceipt` records DHR 1971/1974 DOI authority, and
  `TannakaKreinFibreFunctorReceipt` records the finite fibre functor
  `p2 -> C^1`, `p3 -> C^2`, `p5 -> C^3` with Tannaka/Deligne authority,
  including `arXiv:math/0206028`, as an external boundary.
- `ConditionalGDHRSMPromotionReceipt` records the weaker
  `conditionalOnDRAuthority` status and directly consumes the original
  DHR-paper authority receipt as part of the external condition.  No full
  promotion was made: arbitrary-sector DR theorem application, compact group
  construction, category equivalence to `Rep(G)`, concrete `G_DHR -> G_SM`,
  exact SM matching, and unconditional `G_DHR ~= G_SM` all remain false.

# 2026-05-28 Gate 5 B6 memory update

- Updated Gate 5 penguin memory after the checksum/residual implementation.
  The supplied `HEPData:ins2922449` / record `160745` Table 16 YAML hash is
  `47868e1936dc9f8b4bd20f2aa25ffe2350307737b346394d252d8c5b256ef256`; the
  companion local JSON hash is
  `e182f28137dae0f43be0b99c11d728cd9509d09cc47f66cd64462a897738ea43`.
  Both artifacts are rejected for P5' because they describe normalized
  b-tagged jet mass, not a P5' value/covariance table.
- Recorded the residual classification without promoting it:
  `[4,6] = -2.8 sigma`, `[6,8] = -3.0 sigma`, status
  `p5PrimeBorderlineAnomalyCandidate`, with accepted residual construction and
  frozen residual-vector artifact still false.
- Bound the current full Run 1+2 HEPData value/correlation artifacts:
  `10.17182/hepdata.167733.v1/t2` with SHA256
  `8ee74f4e774889eced2090fe60bbdaf681dd327dc1a349add992e038c7f62623`, plus
  total/stat/syst correlation JSON SHA256 values
  `d3ce138b3d7a3fe0a2777fe87ebe2e9161f14ff4d1ca66ff576d6e271a03c624`,
  `452a3252a6648dc1a0bd3d48907c271850f646c2c0339f07c8a151ab16edf5c0`, and
  `d15787e808c195ce4126483b6f7d524b49f718320728a06555c1cb4f3b05a7d8`.
- Remaining limitations are unchanged in kind: SM/Wilson/flavio/CKM/projection-code
  freeze authorities and no-posterior-tuning attestation are still missing, so
  accepted residual promotion remains false.

# 2026-05-22 tranche C

- Landed the tranche-C worker outputs as concrete Agda modules:
  `DiscreteFormsOnDepth9`, `Depth9ConnectionAndCurvature`,
  `FieldStrengthTransportOnGaugeBundle`, `HodgeVariationPairingDepth9`, and
  `ContractedBianchiMatterClosure`.
- Added the new modules to `DASHI/Everything.agda` and validated the whole
  tree with `agda -v0` plus `DASHI/Everything.agda`.
- Gate 3 transport/variation and Gate 4 matter closure remain fail-closed
  where the upstream blockers are still exact and uninhabited.

# Devlog

- 2026-05-21: Added the Terminal-l6 timeout-module current-wave monitor.
  - `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now exposes
    `canonicalL6TimeoutModuleCurrentWaveMonitorReceipt`.
  - The monitor consumes the real current receipts from
    `YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction` and
    `GRDiscreteRicciCandidateFromCurvature`, then delegates terminal promotion
    to `canonicalGate8L6TerminalMonitorReceipt`.
  - No receipt is promoted into authority: strict YM, sourced Einstein,
    Candidate256, Gate8, and `terminalClaimPromoted` all remain false.
  - Validation: direct Ricci candidate check passes. Terminal boundary and
    terminal-open/root checks are blocked in imported DHR/Ricci surfaces before
    reaching this new ledger; details are in the active blocker board.

- 2026-05-21: Rechecked the middle6 tranche with targeted worker lanes.
  - YM lane confirmed `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar` as the
    first irreducible blocker.
  - GR/Stone lane confirmed the existing hard-closed flags in
    `GRNonFlatScalarAlgebraSurface.agda` and the Stone physical/quotient
    surfaces; no safe promotion was available.
  - AQFT/terminal lane confirmed `missingDASHILocalAlgebra` as the canonical
    irreducible AQFT blocker and found no allowed-file proof promotion.
  - No code changes were required for this recheck; the tranche remains
    fail-closed.

- 2026-05-21: Ran two six-worker hard-blocker waves and integrated the
  resulting fixes.
  - YM: `YMSFGCUserSuppliedNonFlatConnectionCarrier` is now inhabited by an
    SFGC-backed bridge with curvature projection; strict holonomy,
    field-strength transport, Hodge/current, variation, and `D * F = J` laws
    remain fail-closed.
  - GR: `selectedCovariantDerivativeOfMetric` now reduces to `r0`, with
    `selectedMetricCompatibilityWitness` consumed through
    `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR`; the next selected blocker is
    `missingCarrierConnectionIsLeviCivita`.
  - Ricci: `GRDiscreteRicciCandidateFromCurvature` now exposes local Ricci
    fibres and boundary-only contraction, with the sourced-Einstein surface
    kept lightweight to avoid global eager normalization.
  - AQFT/DHR: `DASHILocalAlgebraNet` and `dASHILocalAlgebraNet` are inhabited
    from the C-star completion authority and consumed by DHR adapter receipts;
    arbitrary-sector identity remains blocked because `EndomorphismAction` is
    still abstract.
  - CKM: `Matter.MixingMatrix` is concrete over Gaussian-rational
    Wolfenstein data.  Exact `V V† = I` is false for this approximation, with
    residual entries recorded, so exact unitary CKM construction remains open.
  - Validation: targeted YM, GR, Ricci, AQFT/GNS, DHR, CKM, terminal, and root
    `DASHI/Everything.agda` checks pass; `git diff --check` passes.

- 2026-05-21: Added the post-terminal layer integration ledger.
  - `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now exposes
    `canonicalPostTerminalLayerIntegrationLedger`.
  - It consumes the landed u1 finite/internal spectral-gap, u2 Gate 3 latest
    instantiation, u3 W4 scope correction, u4 selected-metric API refactor,
    u5 finite Stone/YM bridge, and u6 Doplicher-Roberts scoping receipts.
  - The ledger keeps Clay, W4/Candidate256, selected Levi-Civita, physical
    Stone, DR/SM, and `terminalClaimPromoted` false.  Targeted terminal Agda
    validation passes, and root `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 under the 300s
    command.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the upper6 authority-scoping / finite-gap wave.
  - u1 added `U1FiniteCarrierSpectralGapInternalLayerFailClosedReceipt`,
    threading existing finite-depth mass-gap and local finite Casimir evidence
    while keeping finite `H_YM` spectrum and finite-volume uniformity as exact
    missing APIs.
  - u2 added `U2Gate3LatestInstantiationDecisionReceipt`, recording that the
    m1-parametrized handoff cannot instantiate until strict non-flat curvature,
    selected Lie algebra, field-strength transport, current source/coupling,
    and Hodge variation pairing land.
  - u3 added `U3StressEnergyW4ScopeCorrectionReceipt`, separating local
    tensor-shaped construction from external physical coupling/source-unit
    normalization and preserving W4/Candidate256 fail-closed boundaries.
  - u4 added `GRU4SelectedMetricCompatibilityAPIRefactorTargetReceipt`,
    naming the required selected-metric API contract after the r0/r1 bridge
    obstruction.
  - u5 added `U5FiniteStoneYMSpectralBoundBridgeReceipt`, threading finite YM
    gap evidence into the finite Stone side while keeping the actual spectral
    inequality blocked by missing numeric threshold and Hamiltonian-generator
    comparison.
  - u6 added `DHRDoplicherRobertsScopingCorrectionReceipt` and hexagon wiring:
    DR is valid citation authority but is not consumed until local H1-H5 DHR
    categorical evidence exists as terms.
  - Root repaired a terminal boolean/proof-field mismatch for Gate 5
    spacelike-commutativity status.  Validation: `DASHI/Everything.agda`
    exits 0, terminal composition checks, `git diff --check` passes, and no
    forbidden promotion was introduced.

- 2026-05-21: Integrated the middle6 latest assigned proof-attempt wave.
  - Gate 3 added `canonicalYMSFGCLatestFirstMissingConcreteAttemptReceipt`,
    proving only local finite SU2-like/Jacobi, reference Wilson-loop, u2 `D_A`,
    and m2 Hodge/current probes while retaining the strict non-flat curvature
    and selected transport/current/variation blockers.
  - Gate 4 added `canonicalGRLatestWaveDoubledChristoffelMetricCompatibilityReceipt`,
    with doubled zero-table arithmetic and the selected `r1` half obstruction.
  - Gate 5 added `canonicalL5L6M4U5AQFTGNSStoneLocalAlgebraClosureFailClosedReceipt`,
    naming the missing C-star/local-operator/causal-BFS constructors for
    `missingDASHILocalAlgebra`.
  - Gate 6 added `canonicalDHRUpper6EndomorphismActionReplacementInspectionReceipt`,
    preserving `EndomorphismAction` as abstract until semantic local algebra
    action data exists.
  - Gate 7 added `canonicalCKMRationalOneFifthLeadingCarrierAttemptReceipt`
    for rational `epsilon = 1/5` leading CKM/Jarlskog bookkeeping.
  - Terminal composition added `canonicalMiddle6LatestAssignedProofAttemptLedger`.
    Root Agda exits 0; no promotion flags were raised.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the upper6 dense-domain / strong-continuity /
  identity-action replacement wave.
  - u1 added `U1Gate2FiniteYMFormalDomainTerm`,
    `u1Gate2FiniteFormalDenseDomainCandidate`, and
    `U1Gate2DenseDomainHYMSymmetryFailClosedReceipt`, naming the missing dense
    domain, quotient inner product, Laplacian/potential actions, symmetry
    lemmas, and Friedrichs/self-adjoint extension APIs.
  - u2 added `U2Gate3ConsumeM1`, parametrized over the m1 non-flat curvature /
    selected Lie algebra handoff plus connection one-form, field-strength
    transport, and `D_A^2=[F,_]` dependencies.
  - u3 added `U3ValuationMatterReceiptInterfaceAttemptReceipt`, keeping the
    valuation matter interface halted at absent canonical YM connection,
    selected metric, stress-energy tensor, Noether, Bianchi, and trace-pairing
    constructors.
  - u4 added the selected metric compatibility bridge obstruction: the doubled
    residual closes to `r0`, but the selected obligation still unfolds through
    `selectedCovariantDerivativeOfMetric` to the existing `r1 = r0`
    counterexample.
  - u5 added `U5PhysicalStrongContinuityFiniteTraversalFailClosedReceipt`,
    threading finite Stone continuity while naming missing physical
    traversal-unitary, Hilbert norm, epsilon-delta, and phase-continuity APIs.
  - u6 added `DHRUpper6EndomorphismActionReplacementInspectionReceipt` and
    hexagon wiring, preserving `EndomorphismAction` as an abstract action
    carrier instead of fabricating an identity-only constructor.
  - Validation: `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 with the 300s command,
    `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` checks, `git diff --check` passes,
    and no terminal/Clay/W4/Candidate256/physical Stone/DHR/DR/SM promotion was
    introduced.

- 2026-05-21: Prepared the l2 Middle6 current-wave ledger stub.
  - Added `canonicalMiddle6CurrentWaveLedgerStub` to
    `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`.
  - The stub consumes only `canonicalMiddle6AssignedWorkerCompletionLedger` and
    `canonicalLower6CurrentWaveCKMTerminalAuthorityIntegrationLedger`, both
    already imported through the terminal module.
  - Future Gate 2-7 / terminal worker receipts remain named no-import slots
    until their canonical surfaces land.  `terminalClaimPromoted` remains
    false.

- 2026-05-21: Integrated the middle6 assigned-worker completion wave.
  - Added `canonicalMiddle6AssignedWorkerCompletionLedger` to
    `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`, consuming the returned Gate 2,
    Gate 3, Gate 4, Gate 5, Gate 6/Gate 1, and Gate 7 receipts plus the
    current-wave YM/AQFT/Stone/DHR/CKM surfaces.
  - Repaired integration blockers in AQFT quotient relation/norm fields,
    Stone modular bridge audit fields, and DHR identity-action audit fields by
    using named/boolean evidence instead of invalid proof-relevant `Setω`
    fields.
  - Validation: `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`
    passes.  All hard promotions remain false.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the upper6 doubled-Christoffel / identity-action wave.
  - u1 added `U1Gate2S8RealYMQuotientNormDependencyReceipt`, recording that
    S8 real YM quotient-norm promotion depends on the doubled-Christoffel /
    integral metric-compatibility route while keeping real quotient,
    self-adjointness, spectral-gap, Clay, and terminal promotion false.
  - u2 added `YMSFGCU2Upper6BoundedDASquaredReceipt` over the existing local
    finite nonabelian carrier and finite `D_A^2=[F_A,_]` law; strict real SU3
    remains blocked by non-flat curvature and selected Lie algebra carriers.
  - u3 added `W4FullComponentStressEnergyConstructorAuditReceipt`, naming the
    full component family and source pairing as empty typed targets while
    preserving W4/Candidate256 fail-closed authority boundaries.
  - u4 added `GRU4Upper6DoubledChristoffelIntegralMetricCompatibilityReceipt`;
    the doubled route is recorded, but the selected slot still has the
    `r0/r1` contradiction, so selected metric compatibility and Levi-Civita
    promotion remain false.
  - u5 added `Upper6GNSBridgeMapIsometrySurjectivityAttemptReceipt`, threading
    current GNS/Fell/Modular and finite Stone surfaces while recording the
    missing GNS-to-DASHI Hilbert bridge API.
  - u6 added `DHRIdentityEndomorphismActionConstructorShapeReceipt` and wired
    it through the hexagon upper6 surface; `EndomorphismAction` is a postulated
    bare `Set`, so no local identity constructor or arbitrary-sector identity
    theorem was fabricated.
  - Root repaired terminal Gate 5 strong-continuity wiring after integration.
  Validation: `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` passes,
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 under the 300s command, `git diff --check`
  passes, and the forbidden positive-promotion audit is clean.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the requested upper6 continuation wave.
  - u1 added finite gauge-orbit, quotient-carrier, and Hamiltonian-shape
    receipts over the existing finite `YMConnectionCarrier`, while keeping
    real quotient, dense domain, self-adjointness, spectral gap transport, and
    `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint` fail-closed.
  - u2 added `YMSFGCU2Upper6SU3FibreConnectionLiftAuditSurface`, consuming the
    local finite covariant-derivative carrier and recording exact dependencies
    on non-flat curvature, selected Lie algebra, and field-strength transport.
  - u3 added `dASHIStressEnergyTensorConstructorAuditSurface`, naming the
    required YM connection, selected metric, tensor carrier, density, trace,
    Lorentz/gauge invariance, and Noether conservation constructors without
    promoting W4/Candidate256 authority.
  - u4 added `GRGate4Upper6SelectedChristoffelAttemptReceipt`, showing the
    inspected Christoffel numerator is odd (`r1`), no proof-relevant half is
    available, and the selected non-flat compatibility counterexample remains.
  - u5 added `GNSHilbertBridgeReceipt`, threading the current Modular/GNS
    Hilbert input to the finite DASHI Hilbert target while leaving bridge map,
    isometry, surjectivity, strong continuity, and physical Stone promotion
    false.
  - u6 added supplied `DHRGlobalForeignLaneIdentityBundle` wiring and
    `DHRUpper6ArbitrarySectorIdentityEndomorphismFailClosedReceipt`; arbitrary
    identity semantics remain blocked by the missing identity action
    constructor and missing DASHI local algebra.
  - Root integration repaired universe-level receipt fields in Balaban,
    GNS/Fell, Stone, DHR, and terminal surfaces by using boolean threading
    evidence instead of equality over `Setω` records.
  Validation: targeted upper/QFT/terminal Agda checks passed, `git diff --check`
  passed, and
  `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`
  exited 0.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the next requested middle6 orchestrator wave to
  completion.
  - u1 added the YM quotient/Hamiltonian/symmetry attempt receipt and preserved
    the Friedrichs/self-adjointness plus `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint`
    halts.
  - Gate 3 added finite arithmetic residuals for cross-product, Wilson-loop,
    and epsilon-contraction obligations without promoting strict real
    curvature or Hodge/variation.
  - Gate 4 exposed consumable local stress-energy constructors and retained
    the selected non-flat metric counterexample at `missingMetricCompatibility`.
  - l5/m4/u5 added local-algebra, GNS bridge, and Stone strong-continuity
    attempt receipts while keeping C-star/BW/physical phase-space promotion
    false.
  - u6/l3 added arbitrary-sector and left-adjoint/filtered-colimit routes as
    exact fail-closed receipts; DR and Standard Model matching remain blocked.
  - m5/m6/l1 added exact arithmetic and CKM carrier-handoff receipts while
    preserving eigenbasis, product-closure, unitarity, DHR, and Higgs blockers.
  Integration: fixed a DHR universe target and converted CKM/terminal
  over-specific proof checks into Boolean audit flags; added
  `canonicalMiddle6OrchestratorContinuationLedger`.  Validation:
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the requested middle6 continuation wave to completion.
  - l5 added `AQFTFirstMissingChainReceipt`, advancing quotient construction
    and precise quotient relation accounting while preserving C-star,
    time-slice, BW, DR, DASHI-local-algebra, and terminal fail-closed
    boundaries.
  - u6 added selected primitive-lane identity witness fail-closed receipts;
    supplied-sector paths remain usable, but arbitrary identity endomorphism
    semantics still require `missingDASHILocalAlgebra` and sector APIs.
  - Gate 3 added `YMSFGCGate3FirstMissingPrimitiveWorkerReceipt`; Gate 4
    threaded the local DASHI matter-lagrangian interface and retained the
    selected non-flat metric counterexample; Gate 7 added the explicit FN
    charge table; Gate 2/l6 recorded real-carrier/natural-unit/Clay
    fail-closed receipts.
  - m4/u5 consumed the l5 chain into GNS/Fell, modular, and Stone fail-closed
    receipts; l3 recorded filtered-colimit and DHR compatibility residuals;
    l2 wired all wave receipts into the terminal ledger with
    `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.
  Validation: `git diff --check` passed, the forbidden promotion audit found
  no code-level true promotions, and
  `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`
  exited 0.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the requested upper6-only implementation wave.
  - u1 inhabited the finite SFGC `YMConnectionCarrier` and
    `canonicalFiniteSFGCSite2DYMConnectionCarrier`, then added
    `RealYMCarrierQuotient`, `SelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotientCarrierShape`,
    and `S8RealYMCarrierQuotientShapeAuditReceipt` as fail-closed real target
    shapes.  Root repaired a `Setω` equality issue by using boolean canonical
    flags for the `Setω` target shapes.
  - u2 added `NonAbelianCovariantDerivativeCarrier` and
    `canonicalLocalFiniteNonAbelianCovariantDerivativeCarrier`, threading
    `connOneForm`, `discreteDiff`, `DA`, `DA-def`, and the local finite
    `DA²` obligation while keeping strict real SU3 promotion false.
  - u3 added `W4MatterStressEnergyConcreteInterfaceAttemptReceipt` and
    `FactorVecValuationMatterReceiptInterfaceFailClosedReceipt`; local
    FactorVec/zero-table laws are inhabited, but the valuation matter
    interface still lacks consumable YM connection, selected metric, and
    authority-backed stress-energy constructors.
  - u4 split the GR metric lane: flat selected finite-chart compatibility is
    proved by `grFlatSelectedFiniteChartMetricCompatibilityTheorem`, while
    the selected non-flat counterexample remains and non-flat promotion stays
    blocked at `missingMetricCompatibility` / `missingCarrierConnectionIsLeviCivita`.
  - u5 added `PhysicalTraversalUnitaryGroupReceipt` and threaded finite Stone
    group, strong-continuity obligation, generator, and GNS Hilbert carrier
    staging without promoting physical Stone data.
  - u6 added the DHR identity endomorphism audit and supplied-sector identity
    path; arbitrary-sector identities remain blocked by
    `missingIdentityEndomorphismActionConstructor`,
    `missingDASHILocalAlgebraForIdentityActionSemantics`, and AQFT
    `missingPreciseQuotientRelation`.
  Validation: targeted Agda passed for all upper touched modules,
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` passed, `git diff --check` passed
  on the upper touched file set, and
  `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`
  exited 0.  Terminal, Clay, W4/Candidate256, real YM, strict SU3/Hodge,
  non-flat GR, physical Stone, arbitrary DHR, DR, Gate 1, and SM promotion
  remain false.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the middle6 18-worker wave to completion.
  - Gate 3 returned `canonicalYMSFGCGate3M1U2M2WorkerReceipt`; the strict
    residuals are still `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`,
    `missingFieldStrengthTransportActionOnSelectedGaugeBundle`,
    `missingSFGCFibreRepresentationIntoSU3Carrier`, and
    `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar`.
  - Gate 4 returned `FactorVecGate4DASHIMatterStressEnergyFinalReceipt`,
    `W4MatterStressEnergyGate4HardHaltReceipt`,
    `GRGate4SourcedEinsteinFailClosedHandoffReceipt`, and
    `GRDiscreteRicciGate4SelectedChainFailClosedReceipt`; sourced GR remains
    blocked by metric compatibility, matter-interface, W4/Candidate256, and
    contracted-Bianchi source obligations.
  - Gate 7 returned `CKMGate7M5M6L1ClosureReceipt` with typechecking repairs;
    concrete normalized `U_u`, `U_d`, and `V_CKM` remain hidden behind opaque
    `Matter.MixingMatrix`.
  - Gate 2/l6/l4 returned conditional finite-carrier spectral-bound and
    formal Taylor/kinetic matching receipts, with real YM and Candidate256
    physical calibration still external.
  - Terminal wiring consumes all returned handoffs while keeping
    `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.
  Validation: targeted Agda checks, `DASHI/Everything.agda`, `git diff --check`,
  and the forbidden positive-promotion audit all pass.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the upper-six-only orchestration wave.
  - u1 added `S8RealYMCarrierQuotientImplementationAudit` and repaired adjacent
    finite-carrier wiring equality fields; the real YM quotient, Hamiltonian,
    self-adjoint domain, symmetry proof, and real spectral-bound transport
    remain unconstructed because the repo still lacks the real
    `YMConnectionCarrier`, gauge quotient, quotient norm, connection
    Laplacian, plaquette-potential operator, and dense self-adjoint domain.
  - u2 added `YMSFGCU2RealSU3CovariantDerivativeAttemptReceipt`, threading the
    local finite `connectionOneFormAsFibreAlgebra` / Lie3 covariant-derivative
    evidence while keeping strict real non-abelian derivative and m2 handoff
    promotion false.
  - u3 added `DASHIMatterLagrangianCouplingReceipt`, a FactorVec-local coupling
    receipt, and terminal ledger wiring for the local supported stress-energy
    laws; `missingValuationMatterReceiptInterface` and W4/Candidate256
    authority still block promotion.
  - u4 repaired the selected metric-compatibility counterexample field type in
    `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`; non-flat GR still blocks at
    `missingMetricCompatibility` and source attachment remains W4-gated.
  - u5 added `U5GNSHilbertToStoneHandoffReceipt`, consuming current GNS/Fell
    staging, the finite selected projection scalar socket, finite Stone
    receipts, and u1's local finite spectral-bound flag while keeping
    physical Stone promotion halted at
    `targetGlobalNoncollapsedPhysicalPhaseSpace` /
    `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint`.
  - u6 added local-algebra precondition and arbitrary-sector construction
    blocked receipts; `missingDASHILocalAlgebra` is still absent, with the
    current AQFT residual at `missingPreciseQuotientRelation`, so arbitrary
    DHR sectors, DR reconstruction, Gate 1 semantics, and SM matching remain
    unpromoted.
  Validation:
  - Targeted Agda passed for all upper-six touched modules, including
    `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`.
  - `git diff --check` passed for the upper-six touched files.
  - A sidecar `DASHI/Everything.agda` run with a 300s timeout exited 0, but no
    terminal claim was promoted because the upper-six mathematical blockers
    above remain inhabited as blockers.

- 2026-05-21: Added u1/l6/l4 Gate 2 follow-up receipt hardening.
  - `PressureBelow15SpectralTheoremObstruction.agda` now exposes
    `U1ConditionalFiniteCarrierSpectralBoundReceipt`, consuming the local ST3
    finite-carrier spectral-bound source and conditional preprint authority
    boundary while keeping real YM quotient transport, Hamiltonian
    construction, self-adjointness, spectral-gap, Clay, and terminal promotion
    false.
  - `PressureBelow15SpectralNatWitnessSlice.agda` now wires the bounded Nat
    witness to that receipt through
    `S8NatConditionalFiniteCarrierSpectralBoundWiringReceipt`; the first real
    carrier blocker remains
    `missingSelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotient`.
  - `BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt.agda` now records
    `FormalTaylorKineticMatchingReceipt`, pairing the symbolic first Taylor
    correction `c^2 |p|^2 / (2 E0)` with the kinetic target
    `|p|^2 / (2 m)` under the definitional Nat surface `E0 = m c^2`.
  - Candidate256 physical calibration and Agawa/preprint authority remain
    non-promoting; no constructorless authority token is inhabited.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the Gate 5-8 manager pass.
  - l5 added `AQFTL5CarrierIsotonyFrontierReceipt`, consuming the local
    quotient/precise-relation/operation/norm staging and identifying
    `missingIsotonyFromCarrierTransport` as the first exact AQFT net blocker.
  - m4/u5 added Tomita, GNS-Fell, and Stone fail-closed frontier receipts; the
    first modular blocker is `missingTomitaOperator`, and Stone remains halted
    at `targetGlobalNoncollapsedPhysicalPhaseSpace` without
    `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint`.
  - Gate 6/8 added `DHRCarrierTerminalFinalFailClosedReceipt`, wiring the DHR
    arbitrary-sector, AQFT local algebra, Gate 1 semantics, SM match,
    CKM/DHR, Stone, stress-energy, and W4 blockers while keeping
    `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.
  - Gate 7/l1 added CKM arithmetic/carrier frontier receipts; real
    `Matter.MixingMatrix` diagonalizers/product data, CKM closure/unitarity,
    `vHiggsAdapter4Boundary`, `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility`, and
    `missingCarrierMixingTheorem` remain open.
  Validation:
  - Targeted Agda passed for AQFT quotient, ModularTheory, GNSFell, Stone,
    DHRHexagon, DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction, DHRGaugeReceiptSurface,
    CarrierToPhysicsInterpretationFunctor, CKMEntryField,
    CKMCarrierMixingReceipt, and GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`:
    exit 124 while checking `DHRHexagonProofPlanSurface`, so the root check is
    still inconclusive and non-promoting.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the middle6 continuation pass and integrated the
  ready-lane worker returns.
  - m1 threaded the finite-C4/SFGCSite2D curvature advancement into the main
    YM obstruction record; m2/u2 consumed it in the YM receipt with selected
    Hodge/current, local fibre-algebra, lattice, and zero-IBP staging.
  - m3/u4 advanced selected finite-R metric inspection; the selected metric
    compatibility slot records an explicit blocker rather than a false
    Levi-Civita promotion.
  - u3 added full flat stress-energy component staging and W4 external halt
    accounting.
  - l5 advanced AQFT restricted/depth/colimit handoff data; downstream m4/u6
    blockers remain `missingGNSUniversalProperty` and
    `missingDASHILocalAlgebra`.
  - m5/m6 staged exact up/down Yukawa arithmetic, Hermitian/characteristic/
    splitting/eigenbasis surfaces, and CKM product ledger surfaces while
    retaining Higgs/DHR/CKM-product blockers.
  - Root repaired integration type errors in finite-R scalar operators,
    duplicate selected finite-R contraction, Setω record equality markers,
    Gate 3 dependent receipt probes, and CKM staged-membership markers.
  Validation:
  - Targeted Agda passed for the touched YM obstruction/receipt, GR finite-R,
    AQFT, DHR, CKM entry/carrier, stress-energy, W4, and balanced-trit modules.
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`:
    exit 124, inconclusive with no surfaced type error before timeout.

- 2026-05-21: Started the Upper6 continuation wave requested to iterate all
  tranches until completion or honest hard halt.
  - Parallel slices: Gate 3 YM/Hodge, Gate 4 finite-R GR, Gate 4
    stress-energy, Gate 5 AQFT/GNS/Stone, Gate 7 Yukawa/CKM, and
    Gate 6/Gate 1/Gate 8 DHR/functor/authority ledger.
  - Local root slice after the agent cap: Gate 2 S8 real carrier and l6
    balanced-trit dispersion.
  - Each slice has disjoint write ownership and must preserve existing dirty
    work; external authority, physical-unit, terminal, Clay, GR, YM, DHR, SM,
    and W-token promotion remain forbidden unless the exact required terms and
    validations exist.

- 2026-05-21: Collected and integrated the Upper6 continuation wave.
  - Gate3 advanced selected endpoint gauge factors and
    `connectionOneFormAsFibreAlgebra` staging; strict non-flat curvature
    remains `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`.
  - Gate4 GR advanced metric-compatibility staging; next exact blocker is
    `missingCarrierConnectionIsLeviCivita`.
  - Gate4 stress-energy added the full p2-time 4x4 component family but still
    blocks at `missingValuationMatterReceiptInterface` / W4 authority.
  - Gate5 moved AQFT to `missingQuotientConstruction`, added GNS universal
    property staging, finite quotient scalar positivity, and the Stone
    `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint` hard halt.
  - Gate7 added entry-field membership, Hermitian products, symbolic spectral
    arithmetic, and CKM product carrier staging; root fixed finite universe
    levels.  Next arithmetic blocker is `missingCKMProductClosureWitness`.
  - Gate6/Gate1/Gate8 added supplied-foreign-identity consumption, DR H1-H5
    evidence surfaces, and fail-closed terminal/authority ledgering.
  - l6 local added the 15-lane prime-bump weighted `|p|^2` theorem and
    Taylor-remainder target, still halted at Candidate256 physical calibration.
  Validation: all touched targeted Agda checks pass after integration;
  `git diff --check` passes; `Everything.agda` exits 124 under the 30s policy.

- 2026-05-21: Launched Upper6 continuation wave 2 against the new local
  frontier.
  - Active blockers: `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`,
    `missingCarrierConnectionIsLeviCivita`, `missingQuotientConstruction`,
    `missingCKMProductClosureWitness`,
    `residualGlobalForeignLaneIdentityRequiresExplicitWitness`, and
    `missingValuationMatterReceiptInterface` / W4.
  - File ownership is again disjoint; promotions remain false unless exact
    inhabited terms and validation exist.

- 2026-05-21: Collected and validated Upper6 continuation wave 2.
  - YM now has finite-local non-flat curvature and finite holonomy/Lie/trace
    evidence, while strict real/SU3/Hodge blockers remain.
  - GR now has selected Levi-Civita equality, zero-table bracket-defect,
    Bianchi, Ricci/scalar/Einstein staging; next local blocker is
    `missingCurvatureToRicciEinsteinContractionBoundary`.
  - AQFT moved to `missingPreciseQuotientRelation`; GNS moved to
    `missingCyclicSeparatingVector`; Stone remains UniformBalaban-blocked.
  - CKM added the `Matter.MixingMatrix` product-closure attempt and now
    blocks at `missingUnitarityResidualWitness`.
  - DHR added a supplied-sector identity handoff but arbitrary sectors still
    require `residualGlobalForeignLaneIdentityRequiresExplicitWitness`.
  - Stress-energy added local zero-table conservation/source staging and W4
    hard-halt accounting.
  Validation: all touched targeted checks pass; `git diff --check` passes;
  `Everything.agda` exits 124 after reaching `DASHI.Everything`.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the final-local Upper6 wave 3 and stopped at honest
  blockers.
  - AQFT/GNS moved to `missingIsotonyFromCarrierTransport` and
    `missingTomitaOperator`.
  - GR moved sourced compatibility to
    `missingStressEnergyCompatibilityForContractedBianchi` / W4.
  - CKM final-local unitarity remains blocked by absence of concrete
    normalized `U_u` / `U_d` entries behind `Matter.MixingMatrix`.
  - DHR/Gate1 still requires arbitrary-sector foreign identity witnesses,
    AQFT local algebra, and exact SM carrier-functor semantics.
  - YM finite evidence cannot promote to the strict user-supplied real
    YM/SU3/Hodge carriers.
  - Terminal remains fail-closed at
    `Gate1/Gate6.missingExactStandardModelCarrierFunctorMatch`, external
    W4/Candidate256, `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint`, Clay, and
    `Everything.agda` exit-0 validation.
  Validation: targeted checks pass across the touched wave-3 surfaces;
  `git diff --check` passes; `Everything.agda` exits 124 after reaching the
  aggregate module.

- 2026-05-21: Upper6 root started the requested 18-worker implementation
  allocation with dependency gating rather than unsafe parallel theorem edits.
  - Active implementation lanes: u1 S8 real/non-Nat carrier boundary, m1
    non-flat SFGC curvature, m3 finite-R scalar algebra, l5 AQFT local
    algebra, m6 FactorVec-to-Yukawa/down-matrix frontier, and l6 symbolic
    dispersion bridge.
  - Wait/consume lanes: u2/m2 behind m1; u4 behind m3 and u3; u5/m4/u6
    behind l5 and l3 where applicable; l1 behind m5/m6; l3 behind u6; l2/l4
    as composition and authority collectors.
  - File ownership is disjoint for the active wave, and all workers were told
    to preserve existing dirty-tree edits and avoid terminal, Clay, GR, YM,
    DHR, Standard Model, W3/W4/W5, external-authority, and physical-unit
    promotion.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the Upper6 orchestration implementation wave.
  - u1 added `S8RealPhysicalCarrierTransitionTarget` and
    `S8NatToRealPhysicalCarrierTransitionReceipt`; the first remaining S8
    blocker is `missingSelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotient`, with
    hard external halt `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint`.
  - m1 added `YMSFGCGate3M1NonFlatCurvatureBlockerChainLedger`; first
    non-flat Yang-Mills blocker remains
    `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`.
  - m3 added the concrete finite-R scalar/base/derivation/bracket/Jacobi/
    connection progress surface; local first-seven progress now blocks at
    `missingMetricCompatibility`, while full selected non-flat GR still keeps
    `missingFiniteRScalarAlgebra` as the conservative integration blocker.
  - l5 added `BoundedRestrictedCarrierDepthProgressSurface`; AQFT now first
    blocks at `missingPromotedReceiptPredicate`.
  - m6 supplied the down FactorVec-to-Yukawa and down-3x3 maps with the
    Georgi-Jarlskog y22 socket; next arithmetic blocker is
    `missingEntryFieldMembershipCertificates`.
  - l6 added the symbolic candidate256/pow3/primeBump dispersion and
    sqrt/Taylor/kinetic matching surface; physical units halt at
    `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt`.
  Validation:
  - Targeted Agda passed for S8 Nat witness, GR finite-R, Yang-Mills
    obstruction, CKM entry-field, balanced-trit rest-energy, modular-theory,
    and AQFT quotient surfaces.
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`:
    exit 124, inconclusive while still checking imports.

- 2026-05-21: Assigned and coordinated the lower-six infrastructure lanes for
  the new middle-six wave and carried-forward upper-six blockers.
  - l1 CKM unitarity waits on real Yukawa matrix/eigenbasis/product closure
    data and tracks repo-native symbols rather than a nonexistent
    `CKMProductMatrix`: `Matter.MixingMatrix`,
    `missingCKMProductClosureWitness`, `missingCKMProductFieldClosureProof`,
    `missingCarrierMixingTheorem`, and
    `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility`.
  - l2 owns Gate 8 receipt staging through
    `Paper7Gate1To7ReceiptBundle`, `Paper7FinalProductReceipt`, and
    `canonicalPaper7FirstUninhabitedUpstreamSymbols`; terminal promotion stays
    false unless `DASHI/Everything.agda` passes without timeout.
  - l3 owns Gate 1 carrier-functor completion, first at
    `missingFilteredColimitPreservation`, then
    `missingDHRSectorCompatibility`, with u6's real foreign-lane identity
    witness as the DHR handoff gate.
  - l4 owns the authority ledger for the six-postulate package,
    `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint`, Candidate256/W4, and Clay
    boundaries without fabricating authority tokens.
  - l5 owns AQFT net infrastructure, first blocked at
    `missingRestrictedCarrier`, with downstream `missingDASHILocalAlgebra`,
    `blockedByMissingGate1GaugeRepresentationSemantics`, and
    `missingGNSUniversalProperty`.
  - l6 owns the symbolic E0/mc2 dispersion bridge only up to non-promoting
    formal surfaces; physical-unit semantics halt at
    `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt` /
    `impossibleWithoutExternalAuthority`.

- 2026-05-21: Advanced bounded Middle-six implementation handoffs.
  - m1: `YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now has
    `YMSFGCGate3NonFlatSFGCSite2DHandoffReceipt`, while strict non-flat
    curvature remains blocked at `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`.
  - m3: `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now has
    `GRFiniteRScalarAlgebraHandoffReceipt`, exposing the existing
    `canonicalGRFiniteRCarrierScalarOperations` scalar surface while keeping
    the selected non-flat finite-R scalar algebra undischarged. The first true
    blocker remains `missingFiniteRScalarAlgebra`; the handoff queue also
    names `missingFiniteRBaseCarrier`,
    `missingFiniteRNeighbourhoodOrCellComplex`,
    `missingFiniteRDerivationCarrier`, `missingFiniteRCarrierLieBracket`,
    `missingFiniteRJacobiWitness`, and
    `missingFiniteRConnectionOrShiftLaw`.
  - m5/m6: the local `CKMEntryField.agda` state is already staged through
    up y33 and down y33; m6 did not need to add duplicate entry scaffolding.
    The live entry-field arithmetic blocker is
    `missingFactorVecToYukawaEntryMap`.
  - The DHR compatibility blocker remains
    `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility`; no CKM, terminal, Clay, GR,
    YM, DHR, W-authority, external-authority, or Standard Model promotion was
    made.
  Validation:
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/CKMEntryField.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`: pass.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the fresh middle-six implementation pass from the
  latest wave frontier and integrated two small local fixes.
  - m1 added finite C4/SFGCSite2D lower witnesses for reference non-flat
    curvature `φ1`, endpoint gauge factors, holonomy telescoping/conjugation,
    finite trace/Killing pairing, nontrivial adjoint action, and Ad-invariance.
    Root normalized the finite C4 conjugation helper to the abelian holonomy
    identity so the obstruction module checks.
  - m2 added lower Hodge/current/`D * F = J` Route B staging, while
    `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar` remains open.
  - m3 added concrete four-chart finite-R scalar/base/neighbourhood/
    derivation/bracket/Jacobi/connection staging and moved the GR frontier to
    `missingMetricCompatibility`.
  - m4 added abstract GNS receipts for selected state, null ideal,
    pre-Hilbert quotient, Hilbert representation, cyclic vector density, and
    von-Neumann closure; root added local equality helpers required by the new
    receipt fields.
  - m5 added the up-sector FactorVec-to-FN Yukawa entry map and symbolic
    `U_u` staging behind `vHiggsAdapter4Boundary`.
  - m6 added down-sector FactorVec map, `U_u`/`U_d` dependency, and
    `rho_p o Y_ij = Y_ij o rho_p` obligation surfaces; root adjusted the
    down-matrix receipt facts to assert the reduced matrix state rather than
    equality of proof terms.
  Validation:
  - `agda -i . -l standard-library DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . -l standard-library DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationReceipt.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . -i cubical DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/QFT/ModularTheoryReceiptSurface.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/CKMEntryField.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical DASHI/Physics/Closure/CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda`: pass.
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: exited 124 after
    reaching `DASHI.Everything`; no hard type error was visible before the
    timeout, so aggregate validation remains inconclusive.
  - No CKM, terminal, Clay, GR, YM, DHR, W-authority,
    external-authority, physical-unit, or Standard Model promotion was made.

- 2026-05-21: Assigned and launched the requested Middle-six coordination
  wave.
  - m1 owns Gate 3 non-flat SFGC curvature staging in
    `YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda`.
  - m2 is dependency-prep for Route B Hodge/current/IBP and waits on m1's
    non-flat curvature handoff.
  - m3 owns Gate 4 finite-R scalar/base/derivation/Jacobi staging across
    `GRNonFlatScalarAlgebraSurface.agda` and `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`.
  - m4 prepares the GNS completion handoff but remains blocked on l5's local
    algebra/C*-completion input.
  - m5 audits the up-Yukawa queue because the current repo already stages
    y13-y33 through up-matrix completion.
  - m6 verifies the down-Yukawa frontier before any further
    `CKMEntryField.agda` edits.
  - All lanes are bounded and non-promoting.

- 2026-05-21: Collected the Middle-six worker wave.
  - m1 added `YMSFGCGate3NonFlatSFGCSite2DHandoffReceipt` and kept
    `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature` as the first strict
    non-flat YM blocker.
  - m2 confirmed Route B remains blocked at
    `missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar` until the m1 curvature
    handoff is inhabited.
  - m3 added `GRFiniteRScalarAlgebraHandoffReceipt` and kept
    `missingFiniteRScalarAlgebra` as the first true finite-R GR blocker.
  - m4 confirmed GNS completion is dependency-prep only until l5 supplies
    local algebra/C*-completion and GNS state/representation evidence.
  - m5/m6 found the CKM entry-field queue is already staged through up y33 and
    down y33 in this checkout; the live entry-field blocker is
    `missingFactorVecToYukawaEntryMap`, with
    `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility` still open.
  - Targeted checks passed for the m1, m3, and CKM entry-field surfaces.

- 2026-05-21: Coordinated the requested upper-six proof-construction wave and
  refreshed the Paper 7 blocker ledger.
  - Gate 2 stages bounded Nat carrier-unit normalization and now first blocks
    at the global real/non-Nat carrier theorem
    `S8.missingSelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotient`.
  - Gate 3 stages the coefficient-aware `SU(3)` Jacobi global-carrier route
    and now exposes `missingSFGCFibreRepresentationIntoSU3Carrier` before the
    strict non-flat curvature blocker.
  - Gate 4 stages supported stress-energy authority-boundary and non-flat
    metric-tower receipts, while retaining tensor/source/W4 blockers.
  - Gate 5 stages finite selected projection/scalar progress without physical
    Hilbert/Stone promotion.
  - Gate 6 stages selected foreign-identity packaging while retaining
    `residualGlobalForeignLaneIdentityRequiresExplicitWitness` and downstream
    AQFT/DR blockers.
  - No terminal, Clay, GR, YM, DHR, W-authority, external-authority, or
    Standard Model promotion was made.

- 2026-05-21: Added the bounded flat-sector balanced-trit rest-energy receipt.
  - New module:
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt.agda`.
  - It packages the requested internal receipt bundle:
    `candidate256QuotientT` / involution, `candidate256IntegerAddress`,
    address-negation compatibility,
    `candidate256TritDimensionalInvarianceUnderT`, CDQ
    `countStrongButLast` / `pow3`, SFGC selected p2/p3 `d^2 = 0`,
    `sfgcSite2DVacuumWilsonLoopFlatness`, known-limits causal propagation and
    geometry coherence, `KnownLimitsCompleteLocalRegimeTheorem`, and
    `MinkowskiLimitReceipt.minkowskiQuadratic`.
  - The final stage is an inhabited symbolic readoff
    `restEnergy = massTimesCSquared mass c`, with `restEnergyEqualsMC2 = refl`.
  - It does not prove a formal implication from the TSFV/CDQ stages into
    SFGC/KnownLimits/Minkowski, or a real-analysis limit/Taylor theorem.
  - Boundaries remain explicit: no W4 physical-unit calibration, no non-flat
    Yang-Mills, no sourced GR, no Standard Model/Clay/terminal promotion.
  Validation:
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Physics/Closure/BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt.agda`: pass.

- 2026-05-21: Tightened balanced-trit and Moonshine governance wording after
  read-only worker audits.
  - `BalancedTritRestEnergyReceipt.agda` now says receipt bundle rather than
    implication chain, exposes `balancedTritRestEnergyReceipt mass c`, and
    renames the nonrelativistic/ultrarelativistic limit markers as narrative
    records rather than theorem flags.
  - `DASHIPrimeLaneEquivClosureReceiptSurface.agda` and
    `LaneDimensionTheoremReceiptSurface.agda` now keep the DLM/VOA lane
    dimension route authority-backed and conditional instead of setting local
    promotion flags.
  - Downstream DHR/terminal/gauge receipt strings were aligned to the same
    non-promoting boundary.
  Validation:
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout exit 124, inconclusive, with no hard type error visible.

- 2026-05-21: Re-synchronized the Paper 7 final product publishability
  boundary to the current exact blocker frontier.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda` now updates
    `canonicalPaper7FirstUninhabitedUpstreamSymbols` from stale wave-era
    blockers to the live Gate 1/6, Gate 2, Gate 3, Gate 4, Gate 5, Gate 6,
    Gate 7, and Clay blockers.
  - The new boundary text records the shortest honest route to a publishable
    full-unification claim while keeping `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.
  Validation:
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary.agda`: pass

- 2026-05-21: Coordinated a six-worker Everything-only implementation wave
  while preserving concurrent worker edits outside this allocation. All results
  are bounded and non-promoting.
  - Gate 1/2:
    `PressureBelow15SpectralTheoremObstruction.agda` and
    `PressureBelow15SpectralNatWitnessSlice.agda` now record Nat
    pressure-energy coercivity progress; bounded next field is
    `s8CarrierUnitNormalizationField`, with global
    `SelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotient` still missing.
  - Gate 3:
    `YangMillsFieldEquationReceipt.agda` now stages the flat selected Bianchi
    gauge-compatibility witness; strict non-flat YM remains blocked at
    `missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`.
  - Gate 4:
    `W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt.agda` now records
    `W4MatterStressEnergyAuthorityInterfaceObstruction`, threaded through
    `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`; no W4 token, matter field, stress-energy
    tensor, sourced Einstein law, or GR promotion is constructed.
  - Gate 6:
    `DHRHexagonObligation.agda` now records
    `DHRArbitrarySectorForeignIdentityFieldLattice`; first residual is
    `residualGlobalForeignLaneIdentityRequiresExplicitWitness`.
  - Gate 7/8:
    `CKMEntryField.agda` advances staged down-Yukawa inventory through
    `downY12`; next slot is `missingY13`, with
    `missingConcreteDownYukawa3x3Matrix` still open.
  Validation:
  - Current targeted check of
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt.agda`: pass.
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout exit 124, inconclusive, with no hard type error visible in the final run.

- 2026-05-20: Coordinated a five-worker blocked-check wave with one reserved
  repair slot, keeping all promotion boundaries false.
  - Gate 1/6:
    `DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRGaugeReceiptSurface.agda` now records
    `Gate1Gate6AgreementObstructionReceipt`; the first agreement blocker is
    `missingExactStandardModelCarrierFunctorMatch`.
  - Gate 4:
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda` now
    records
    `FactorVecValuationP2LorentzUnitYMGRStressEnergyCompatibilityReceipt`,
    consumed by `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`; the W4
    matter/stress-energy interface remains the authority blocker.
  - Gate 5:
    `DASHI/Quantum/Stone.agda` now records
    `BoundedStoneGeneratorSpectralGapInterpretationReceipt`, wired through
    `SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda`; global phase space,
    traversal Stone bundle, colimit generator, and spectral-gap bound remain
    open.
  - Gate 7/8:
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda` now records a
    DHR/Yukawa intertwiner request and absence ledger; first compatibility
    blocker is `missingYukawaDHRIntertwinerCompatibility`, with
    `missingConcreteDownYukawa3x3Matrix` still open.
  Validation:
  - Targeted Agda checks passed for all touched theorem modules and
    `CKMEntryField.agda`.
  - `git diff --check` passed on the touched set.
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout exit 124, inconclusive.

- 2026-05-20: Advanced the Paper 7 wave12 Gate 4 hard-symbol lane by
  threading the downstream W4 matter/stress-energy interface diagnostic as
  typed boundary evidence across the local valuation stress-energy progress
  surfaces, without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda` now
    imports `EinsteinEquationCandidate` as `EEC` and extends
    `FactorVecValuationP2LorentzUnitStressEnergyCovariantDivergenceProgress`
    with typed `W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceDiagnostic` /
    first-missing-field witnesses.
  - This keeps the exact next local primitive as
    `missingValuationMatterReceiptInterface` while replacing string-only
    boundary narration with typed first-missing evidence pinned to
    `missingW4AnchorArtifactReceiptForMatterStress`.
  - This remains non-promoting: no
    `W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt` inhabitant is constructed; the
    authority boundary remains external.
  Validation:
  - `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Physics/Closure/FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda`: pass

- 2026-05-20: Advanced the Paper 7 wave11 Gate 3 hard-symbol lane by adding a
  typed flat-connection witness that discharges the local

  SU(3) Jacobi lane by inhabiting the non-representative slot coefficient-term
  supply field and advancing the next exact blocker to all-slot residual
  arithmetic, without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now exposes

  - The canonical coefficient-aware 512-slot carrier/scaffold surfaces now
    advance `firstMissingCoefficientAwareResidualField` from
    `nonRepresentativeSlotCoefficientTermSupplyField` to
    `allSlotCoefficientAwareResidualArithmeticField`, with remaining
    post-first field reduced to

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` now
    exposes `SelectedQuotientPostInnerProductWellDefinednessSocket` and
    canonical
    `selectedQuotientPostInnerProductWellDefinednessSocket`.
  - The new socket threads from
    `SelectedQuotientPostProjectionScalarSocket`, marks selected-finite
    `quotientInnerProductWellDefinednessField` progress as local-only, keeps
    global quotient inner-product promotion false, and advances the next exact
    theorem blocker to `acceptedHilbertCompletionField`.
  - `PhysicalHilbertStoneBundleDataRequest` and
    `SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt` now consume that new socket so
    the Gate 5 blocker lattice reflects second-field progress explicitly.
  - This remains non-promoting: global physical quotient inner-product

    progress through `CKMSVDAuthorityBoundaryLedger` via

  - This remains non-promoting: complete concrete up/down Yukawa matrices,

    The new bounded inhabitant discharges the component-family sub-primitive
    and sets the next exact tensor-candidate blocker to

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now threads that
    progress package through the Gate 4 sidecar via
    `factorVecMetricSupportedUnitStressEnergyTensorComponentFamilyProgress`
    and a typed next-missing symmetry-law witness.

  - `DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRHexagonObligation.agda` now exposes

    for `DHRSuperselectionSectorLaneSupply` once localised-sector equality,
    selected-carrier predicate data, assigned-lane preservation, and global

    `canonicalDHRArbitrarySectorForeignIdentityProgress`, with exact residual
    blockers:
    `blockedByNoArbitrarySectorLaneClassifier`,
    `blockedByNoArbitrarySectorCarrierPredicate`, and
    `blockedByNoArbitrarySectorGlobalForeignLaneIdentity`.

    `canonicalS8NatGlobalCarrierVacuumFieldProgress`, explicitly witnessing the
    bounded Nat vacuum field and naming
    `s8NonVacuumSectorPredicateField` as the next queued field on the blocker.

  through `autonomous-orchestrator`.
  - Gate 1/2 added bounded self-adjoint carrier-field progress and explicitly
    advanced the queued field to `s8VacuumSectorField`, while preserving the
    global real-carrier theorem blocker.
  - Gate 3 added a global coefficient-aware `SU(3)` Jacobi arithmetic
    carrier/slot surface.  Manager-local validation was initially blocked by a
    Gate 4 scope error; root validation passed after Gate 4 landed the missing
    request name.
  - Gate 4 refined stress-energy to a typed component-family request; Gate 5
    decomposed nondegenerate projection/scalar obligations into theorem
    fields; Gate 6 added primitive-scope selected-predicate identity/lane-supply
    progress; Gate 7/8 advanced concrete up-Yukawa progress from `y11` to
    `y12`.
  - Root targeted validation passed on the wave5 touched module set, all wave5
    status JSON files parsed, and diff whitespace checks passed.  Promotion
    state remains false.

  static `y11` blocker to an explicit staged `y11` progress surface, without
  promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CKMEntryField.agda` now exposes
    `canonicalYukawaMatrix3x3EntrySlotsAfterY11Supply` and
    `CKMConcreteUpYukawaY11Progress` (with canonical
    `canonicalCKMConcreteUpYukawaY11Progress`) so the lane records a concrete
    y11 checkpoint and advances the next exact missing up-type entry to `y12`.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda` now threads that
    progress surface through `CKMSVDAuthorityBoundaryLedger`, including
    `entryFieldY11ProgressAdvancesNextMissingUpEntryToY12` and updated
    authority-boundary text.
  - This remains non-promoting: full concrete up/down Yukawa matrices,

    intertwiner compatibility, CKM closure, and W4-authorized calibration

  arithmetic surface from a local witness to a global 512-slot carrier,

    exposes `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3CoefficientAwareAxisTerm`,
    `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3CoefficientAwareJacobiSlot`,
    `localFiniteSU3CoefficientAwareJacobiSlot`, and
    `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3CoefficientAwareJacobi512Carrier` with canonical
    `canonicalYMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3CoefficientAwareJacobi512Carrier`.
  - The canonical SU(3) scaffold now carries a global coefficient-aware
    `8 x 8 x 8` slot function and the specialized `[1,4,5]` arithmetic closure
    witness (`-1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 0`) while keeping non-specialized slots
    explicitly unresolved and global all-slot closure uninhabited.
  - This remains non-promoting: full all-512 coefficient-aware residual
    closure, coefficient-aware-to-coefficient-erased reconciliation, SFGC
    fibre representation, Killing/trace Ad-invariance, and physical YM
    operator laws remain open.

  - `DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRHexagonObligation.agda` now exposes
    `DHRPrimitiveSelectedPredicateForeignIdentitySupplyProgress` and
    `canonicalDHRPrimitiveSelectedPredicateForeignIdentitySupplyProgress`.
  - The new surface records that, when a nondegenerate localised interface is
    supplied on a primitive assigned lane, the repository can construct both a
    selected-predicate global foreign-lane identity request and the downstream
    `DHRSuperselectionSectorLaneSupply` on that primitive constructor path.

    `NondegeneratePhysicalProjectionAlgebraTheoremField`,
    `canonicalNondegeneratePhysicalProjectionAlgebraTheoremFields`, and
    `canonicalNondegeneratePhysicalProjectionAlgebraRemainingFieldsAfterFirstMissing`,
    then threads this canonical decomposition through
    `NondegeneratePhysicalProjectionAlgebraRequest` with first missing field
    `physicalNondegenerateProjectionScalarLawsField`.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` now
    threads the same canonical field decomposition through
    `SelectedQuotientNondegenerateProjectionScalarSocket` so the exact first
    missing field and remaining post-first fields are explicit on the Gate 5
    socket surface.
  - This remains non-promoting: physical nondegenerate projection/scalar laws

    completion, strong continuity, traversal-derived `StoneBundle`, and
    Schrödinger promotion remain open.

  through `autonomous-orchestrator` in the existing `ao-paper7-wave3` tmux
  session.
  - The first wave4 pass selected context recovery only; root treated that as
    insufficient under the implementation policy, seeded the six status files
    for `long-running-development`, and relaunched the same lane managers
    through the AO runner.
  - The implementation pass produced validated Agda progress in all six lanes:
    Gate 1/2 post-self-adjoint S8 field queue, Gate 3 local coefficient-aware
    `[1,4,5]` cancellation, Gate 4 stress-energy tensor-candidate request,
    Gate 5 nondegenerate projection/scalar socket, Gate 6 supplied-interface
    to lane-supply bridge, and Gate 7/8 first missing up-Yukawa entry `y11`.
  - Root targeted validation passed on the touched module set, six wave4
    status JSON files parsed, and diff whitespace checks passed.  No terminal
    or hard theorem promotion was set.

- 2026-05-19: Advanced the Gate 3 SU(3) Jacobi blocker with a local
  coefficient-aware arithmetic witness, without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now exposes

    `localFiniteSU3QuarterCoefficientAdd`, and
    `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3CoefficientAware145ResidualWitness` with canonical
    witness `canonicalYMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3CoefficientAware145ResidualWitness`.
  - The SU(3) scaffold now records a local representative `[1,4,5]`
    coefficient-aware cancellation witness (`-1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4` on axis 2) while
    keeping the coefficient-erased `[1,4,5]` residual obstruction explicit and
    keeping global all-512 Jacobi zero-residual closure unpromoted.
  - This remains non-promoting: global coefficient-aware vector/residual
    arithmetic and an honest all-512 zero-residual witness are still missing,

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` now

    `selectedQuotientNondegenerateProjectionScalarSocket`.
  - The new socket isolates the first pre-completion blocker between finite
    selected-quotient evidence and physical Hilbert promotion:
    nondegenerate projection algebra plus scalar-field laws, and it is threaded
    through both `PhysicalHilbertStoneBundleDataRequest` and
    `SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt`.

    The supported p2-time contracted-Bianchi witness now threads to an explicit

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now consumes that
    request and records the same first missing stress-energy sub-primitive on
    the finite-R Gate 4 sidecar surface.

    `nondegenerateInterfaceToCarrierPredicateRequest`,
    `nondegenerateInterfaceToGlobalForeignIdentityRequest`,
    `primitiveSectorInterfaceToLaneSupply`, and
    `primitiveSectorInterfaceToLaneSupplyBoundary`.
  - The new bridge consumes a supplied

    primitive assigned lane, derives both
    `DHRNonemptySectorCarrierPredicateRequest` and
    `DHRGlobalForeignLaneIdentityForPredicateRequest`, and then constructs
    `DHRSuperselectionSectorLaneSupply` through the existing primitive bridge.

  `autonomous-orchestrator` runner as the canonical control-plane monitor.
  - Gate 1/2:
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PressureBelow15SpectralTheoremObstruction.agda`
    now exposes `SelfAdjointYangMillsHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotient` and a
    supplied-carrier compiler into `S8PressureBelow15ToYangMillsSpectralGapTheorem`.
    `PressureBelow15SpectralNatWitnessSlice.agda` inhabits that route only for
    the bounded Nat/FactorVec slice.
  - Gate 3:
    `YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now records a 64-slot repeated
    first-two-axis `SU(3)` Jacobi zero batch and the coefficient-erased
    `[1,4,5]` residual blocker; `YangMillsFieldEquationReceipt.agda` records
    coefficient-aware residual arithmetic as the next blocker.
  - Gate 4:
    `FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda` now exposes
    `FactorVecValuationP2LorentzUnitContractedBianchiWitness`, and
    `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` consumes it as bounded FactorVec input.
  - Gate 5:
    `SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` now exposes
    `SelectedQuotientFiniteDensitySocket`.
  - Gate 6:
    `DHRHexagonObligation.agda` now packages primitive-sector classification,
    sector-indexed nonempty predicates, and primitive irreducibility evidence.
  - Gate 7/8:
    `CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda` now exposes
    `CKMYukawaCKMPostW4Transition`, pivoting from unavailable W4 scale
    authority to `missingConcreteUpYukawa3x3Matrix`.
  - All changes remain non-promoting: no spectral-gap, YM, GR, DHR, Higgs/CKM,

  - The supported unit p2-time zero Riemann table now contracts to a supported
    zero Ricci table, and the non-flat FactorVec valuation metric surface
    threads that witness as the next socket after supported Riemann.
  - The supported Gate 4 blocker advances to
    `missingValuationContractedBianchiComputation`; global non-flat Ricci,
    contracted Bianchi, stress-energy compatibility, GR promotion, and

    The finite-to-complex-doublet transport surface now records the residual
    `U1_EM` quotient-after-completed-square law as supplied and advances the
    first blocker to `missingW4VHiggsScaleAfterResidualU1EMQuotient`.
  - Gate 4:
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda` now
    exposes `FactorVecValuationP2LorentzUnitInverseMetricWitness` and
    canonical `canonicalFactorVecValuationP2LorentzUnitInverseMetricWitness`.
    The non-flat FactorVec valuation metric surface now carries the

    Christoffel/Riemann witnesses, advancing the supported blocker to

  - `DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRHexagonObligation.agda` now exposes

  - The new helper consumes an existing primitive sector-specific nonempty

    identity request and produces `DHRSuperselectionSectorLaneSupply` on the
    primitive-constructor path.
  - This remains non-promoting: arbitrary `SuperselectionSector`
    classification, repo-supplied global foreign-lane identity evidence, and
    irreducibility evidence remain open; DR classification, gauge
    reconstruction, and symmetric hexagon closure are still unpromoted.

    `firstMissingCarrierTheoremField` through

    `s8SelfAdjointHamiltonianOnCarrierQuotientField`.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PressureBelow15SpectralNatWitnessSlice.agda` now
    carries that first-missing theorem field in
    `S8NatToGlobalSpectralGapPromotionBridge`, preserving the bounded Nat
    bridge as input-only evidence.

  surface without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` now
    exposes `SelectedQuotientStrongContinuitySocket` and
    `selectedQuotientStrongContinuitySocket`.
  - The new socket binds the selected-quotient topology/completion precursor
    to the descended finite advance and its semigroup obstruction, and threads
    the typed upgrade route
    `PhysicalTraversalStoneUpgradeData -> StoneBundleSelfAdjointRoute`.
  - `PhysicalHilbertStoneBundleDataRequest` and
    `SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt` now carry this receipt so the
    strong-continuity/traversal-derived-StoneBundle blocker is explicit in the
    Gate 5 control surface.
  - This remains non-promoting: no nondegenerate physical projection algebra,
    scalar field laws, physical Hilbert completion/density, invertible

  - The new surface packages nonempty selected-carrier predicate evidence for
    the four named primitive sector constructors using the existing G6
    nontrivial carrier witness and definitional assigned-lane preservation.
  - This remains primitive-constructor scoped only: arbitrary
    `SuperselectionSector` classification, global foreign-lane identity,

    `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3Jacobi512Carrier`.
  - The canonical SU(3) scaffold now carries a total positive-axis
    `8 x 8 x 8` Jacobi slot function over the eight generator axes, with
    representative `[1,2,3]`, `[4,5,8]`, and `[6,7,8]` slots named for
    downstream validation. The remaining SU(3) missing primitive is refined
    from the coarse finite carrier/check blocker to the all-zero Jacobi
    residual witness, followed by SFGC fibre representation and Killing/trace
    Ad-invariance.
  - This remains non-promoting: no all-zero residual proof, SFGC fibre
    representation map, physical `D_A` laws, Bianchi transport, Hodge/current,
    sourced equation, spectral gap, or Clay/terminal authority boundary is

    finite-order reflection into the canonical symbolic carrier norm/order
    request surface is supplied and moves the first remaining blocker to

  - This remains non-promoting: no global Yang-Mills Hamiltonian carrier, S8

  rank/nondegeneracy slice without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FactorVecDiscreteMetricTensorSurface.agda` now
    exposes `FactorVecValuationP2LorentzRankNondegenerateWitness`.
  - The witness consumes the checked rational nonzero p2-time and spatial
    signed valuation weights at the unit-support FactorVec base, proves every
    diagonal self component of the p2-time valuation metric nonzero, keeps the
    off-diagonal zero law, and records the finite rank carrier as the existing
    fifteen-coordinate `FactorVecQCoefficientVector`.
  - This discharges only the local unit-support diagonal rank/nondegeneracy

    `SelectedQuotientProjectionInnerProductSurface.quotientInnerProductWellDefined`
    to package a finite selected-quotient topology/completion precursor around
    the representative-independent projection inner product.
  - This remains finite selected-quotient evidence only: physical Hilbert

    `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3StructureTerm`, and the list-valued

    structure coefficients.
  - The canonical scaffold now records checked coefficient witnesses for the
    unit `[1,2]`, half `[1,4]`, `sqrt3/2` `[4,8]`, and multi-output
    `[4,5]` / `[6,7]` Cartan decompositions.  The full structure-constant
    table is no longer listed as a canonical missing primitive.
  - This remains non-promoting: the finite 512-entry Jacobi carrier, SFGC

    Ad-invariance, physical `D_A` laws, Bianchi transport, Hodge/current, and

    `Data.Rational` positivity/nonzero witnesses for all unsigned valuation
    diagonal weights, a checked negative/nonzero witness for the signed p2
    time weight, checked positive/nonzero witnesses for every non-p2 signed
    weight, and a one-time/fourteen-spatial finite lane classifier.
  - This does not promote Gate 4 GR: determinant/rank nondegeneracy,

  - `DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRHexagonObligation.agda` now exposes
    `DHRPrimitiveSectorAssignedLaneEvidence` plus
    `canonicalDHRPrimitiveSectorToLaneClassifierProgress`.
  - The new surface packages reusable assigned-lane evidence for the four
    primitive sector constructors and a localised-endomorphism adapter that
    works when `localisedSector` is explicitly proved equal to one primitive
    sector constructor.
  - This narrows the primitive-constructor lane only: arbitrary sector
    classification, sector-specific nonempty carrier predicates, global
    foreign-lane identity, irreducibility evidence, fusion, DR/Tannaka
    reconstruction, gauge assignment, and symmetric hexagon closure remain

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SchrodingerSelfAdjointEvolutionReceipt.agda` now

    `selectedQuotientProjectionInnerProductSurface`.
  - The surface ties `twoPointNoncollapsedProjectionAlgebraPrecursor` to the
    selected finite quotient carrier with `true -> shiftStartPoint` and
    `false -> shiftHeldExitPoint`, supplies an identity quotient projection,
    a finite Kronecker projection inner product, kept/orthogonal witnesses,
    transport agreement with the two-point precursor, and representative
    independence via
    `shiftWavePhaseSelectedObservationQuotientSurface.quotientSound`.

  - The bridge carries the checked bounded Nat `S8SubThresholdSpectralGapDependency`
    into the named global theorem target
    `S8PressureBelow15ToYangMillsSpectralGapTheorem`, while keeping
    `PressureBelow15SpectralGapReceipt` gated by
    `gapReceiptOnlyFromInhabitedS8Theorem`.

  - `canonicalHiggsFiniteToComplexDoubletTransportSurface` now records that
    the Hermitian norm-squared transport law is supplied and moves the first

  - `canonicalDHRPrimitiveConstructorSurfaceProgress` records that only the
    primitive constructor surface is supplied.  Arbitrary sector-to-lane

    all-lane unit valuation support base.
  - The witness records that the p2 coordinate is the sign-flipped valuation
    weight and every non-p2 coordinate is the positive-orientation valuation
    weight, while keeping nonzero rational weight proofs, determinant/rank,
    Lorentzian inertia, inverse metric, curvature, Ricci, and GR promotion

    projection self-adjointness, a norm-1 kept state, and an orthogonal
    separation witness.
  - `PhysicalHilbertStonePrimitiveRequest` now consumes this precursor while
    keeping `physicalProjectionAlgebraSupplied = false` and
    `quotientInnerProductWellDefinednessSupplied = false`.
  - This remains a finite precursor only: it is not tied to the selected

    `[6,8] -> -7`, `[8,6] -> 7`, `[7,8] -> 6`, and `[8,7] -> -6`.
  - The receipt text now records these generator-8 brackets while preserving
    the exact non-promotion boundary: coefficient-carrying structure
    constants, multi-output Cartan brackets such as the missing full
    `[4,5]` decomposition, finite 512-entry Jacobi check, SFGC fibre

    Hamiltonian transport arithmetic.
  - The slice also exposes

    `s8NatExternalLemmaInterfaceCompiler`, routing the concrete external
    six-witness package through the final internal lane-dominance compiler.

  - `primitiveDHRClassSectorLaneSupplyPrimaryLaneMatchesClass` records that

  - This is conditional constructor wiring only: the repository still lacks an

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now gives
    `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3Scaffold` six checked coefficient-erased
    root-direction witnesses beyond the embedded first-three-generator
    SU(2)-style bracket lane:
    `[1,4] -> 7`, `[1,5] -> -6`, `[2,4] -> 6`, `[2,5] -> 7`,
    `[3,4] -> 5`, and `[3,6] -> -7`.
  - The receipt text now records this stronger scaffold while preserving the
    exact non-promotion boundary: generator 8/Cartan mixed-component brackets,
    coefficient-carrying structure constants, the finite 512-entry Jacobi
    check, SFGC fibre representation, Killing/trace Ad-invariance, Hodge,
    IBP, source coupling, and `D_A`/`F_A` laws remain open.

- 2026-05-19: Advanced the Gate 5 finite-depth generator-domain slice without
  promotion.
  - `DASHI/Quantum/Stone.agda` now exposes
    `DiscreteSymmetricGeneratorDomainTarget`, wrapping the discrete
    generator-domain target with finite-depth inner-product symmetry,
    traversal-domain stability, and generator/step commutation obligations.
  - The one-point identity tower inhabits this stronger target definitionally,
    and the finite-depth skeleton plus discrete Hilbert/Stone receipt now carry
    it alongside the finite-support colimit-domain element.
  - This remains finite-only: no noncollapsed phase space, nondegenerate
    projection algebra, quotient inner-product well-definedness, Hilbert
    completion/density, reversible physical traversal, strong continuity, or
    self-adjoint physical colimit generator is promoted.

  without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PressureBelow15SpectralNatWitnessSlice.agda` now
    exposes a concrete `S8PressureEnergyCoercivityPrimitiveInterface` for the
    bounded `Energy = Nat` test package, supplies the package-specific compiler
    into `pressureEnergyCoercive`, and routes the S8 subthreshold dependency
    through `s8SubThresholdDependencyFromCompilerInterfaceAndNormalization`.
  - The slice still validates only the concrete Nat arithmetic boundary and p3
    non-vacuum lower bound; the full S8/Yang-Mills spectral theorem remains
    unpromoted and blocked at the generic lane-dominance/order-compatibility
    law.

  target without promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now
    exposes `YMSFGCLocalFiniteSU3Scaffold`: an explicit eight-generator
    carrier scaffold whose first three generators embed the already checked
    finite SU(2)-style bracket lane.
  - The scaffold carries checked bracket witnesses for the embedded
    `XY -> Z`, `YZ -> X`, `ZX -> Y`, and `YX -> -Z` first-three-generator
    subalgebra, and is threaded into the non-abelian covariant-derivative
    theorem-thin receipt.
  - This remains below SU(3) promotion: the full eight-generator structure
    constants, finite 512-entry Jacobi check, SFGC fibre representation into
    that carrier, Killing/trace Ad-invariance, Hodge, IBP, source coupling,
    and `D_A`/`F_A` laws remain open.

  promotion.
  - `DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction.agda` now exposes
    `DHRSuppliedSectorTensorFusionTargetSurface`, consuming supplied
    sector-lane packages into nonempty localised carrier semantics for two DHR
    endomorphisms and wiring them to tensor/fusion target sockets.
  - Tensor objects, fusion products, fusion multiplicities, dual sectors,
    DR/Tannaka reconstruction, gauge assignment, and `G_DHR ~= SU3 x SU2 x U1`
    remain explicit non-promoted gaps.

    `DiscreteGeneratorDomainTarget` records over a discrete Hilbert-depth
    embedding system.
  - The existing one-point finite-depth identity Stone tower now inhabits
    both surfaces and wires them into the finite-depth skeleton plus discrete
    receipt, covering fixed-depth Hilbert data, isometric identity embeddings,
    traversal compatibility, a finite-support colimit-domain element, and an
    identity generator/domain target.
  - Physical Stone evolution remains unpromoted: noncollapsed phase space,
    quotient inner-product well-definedness, physical traversal group,
    completion/density, and self-adjoint colimit generator/domain data remain
    open.

  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/YangMillsFieldEquationObstruction.agda` now gives
    the local finite 3-axis sign multiplication and scaling enough
    definitional structure for a checked Jacobi witness, and adds an explicit
    27 ordered-triple positive-axis epsilon/Jacobi table.

    representation boundary, keeping Route A Bianchi-style targets separate
    from Route B sourced `D_A star F_A = J` targets.

    runner -> conformance residual, with explicit simulation, quotient, runner,
    residual, side-information, empirical conformance, and light-closure gates.
  - `DASHI/Interop/ObservationTransportSpine.agda` now names

    double-slit phase coupling, which-path quotients, Feynman/Fermat
    stationary-phase attractors, grating/mask retopology, and quantum-eraser
    one-particle versus coincidence quotients.
  - `DASHI/Interop/QuantumPathLightTransportAnalogyDischarge.agda` links that
    quantum path vocabulary to renderer light transport as a promotion-gated
    target: promotion is intended, and the promoted record requires explicit
    compiler, stationary-phase error-bound, material, visibility, residual,

  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerGap.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerAssumedTheorem.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124`
    with no immediate type error emitted before the bound.

- 2026-04-25: Landed the first non-placeholder Schrödinger-gap inhabitant.
  - `DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerGapShiftInstance.agda`
    now defines a pressure-ordered shift endomap
    `shiftStartPoint -> shiftNextPoint -> shiftHeldExitPoint`
    over the existing three-point carrier.
  - Density is now tied to the packaged empirical lane at the gap level:
    empirical `densityProxy` plus an explicit pressure rank on the shift
    carrier.
  - Amplitude remains a proxy, but it is now also pressure-ordered rather
    than a free slot.
  - The module constructs one concrete
    `SchrodingerAssumedTheorem`
    instance from the resulting witness pair.
  - Follow-on refactor:
    the canonical pressure-ranked density law now lives in
    `DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamicsShiftInstance.agda`,
    and the Schrödinger-gap instance reuses those shared helpers rather than
    shadowing them.
  Validation:
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamicsShiftInstance.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerGapShiftInstance.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerAssumedTheorem.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124`
    while checking `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Consumers/WaveRegime.agda`,
    with no immediate type error emitted before the bound.

- 2026-04-25: Strengthened the core dynamics instance with a bounded
  least-action seam instead of widening the Schrödinger-facing claim surface.
  - `DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamicsShiftInstance.agda`
    now defines `ShiftAdmissibleTarget` for the three-point pressure carrier,
    a bounded `shiftTransitionAction` cost on admissible targets, and a
    `ShiftLeastActionLaw` witness proving that `shiftPressureAdvance` chooses
    the smallest admissible monotone pressure step.
  - `ShiftActionLaw` now packages both the self-action/density bound and the
    least-action witness.
  Validation:
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamicsShiftInstance.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerGapShiftInstance.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/SchrodingerAssumedTheorem.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124`
    while checking `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Consumers/WaveRegime.agda`,
    with no immediate type error emitted before the bound.

- 2026-04-25: Re-ran `robust-context-fetch` on the same Dashi UUID
  `69eb5a54-5f74-839f-96d4-0009db829915`
  to refresh the worker framing before the next implementation round.
  - Exact DB resolution still holds as
    `Classical Quantum Bridge`
    (`d69ca38ba7051141efc5c7245437fe574b6a5057`),
    now with `73` archived messages and latest timestamp
    `2026-04-24T15:15:26+00:00`.
  - The newly recovered tail sharpens the repo-facing constraint:
    do not add a fake Schrödinger proof claim.
    The safe implementation shapes are
    `SchrodingerGap`,
    `SchrodingerAssumedTheorem`,
    and, only if needed for wiring,
    a clearly labelled demo-only mock module.
  - Checked the current repo state before lane assignment:
    `DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamics.agda`
    and
    `DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamicsShiftInstance.agda`
    exist,
    but no Schrödinger-facing modules exist yet.
  - Reopened the implementation-control surface with two active bounded lanes:
    theorem-thin Schrödinger gap consumer,
    and assumption-guarded Schrödinger theorem consumer.
    A third demo-only plumbing lane remains conditional and inactive by
    default.

- 2026-04-24: Ran `robust-context-fetch` on the requested online Dashi thread
  `69eb5a54-5f74-839f-96d4-0009db829915` and reconciled the result against the
  repo's canonical archive notes.
  - The refreshed credentials repaired the live UUID path.
    A direct pull inserted `49` messages into the canonical archive, and the
    exact UUID now resolves from DB as
    `Classical Quantum Bridge`
    with canonical thread ID
    `d69ca38ba7051141efc5c7245437fe574b6a5057`.
  - Confirmed that the local archive still contains strong nearby Dashi
    context, especially
    `Dashi on Quantum Computing`
    and
    `Dashi and Physics Insights`,
    and also confirmed archive-wide hits for
    `double slit`,
    `tunneling`,
    `harmonic oscillator`,
    and `hydrogen atom`.
    So the right repo-facing interpretation is no longer
    "exact UUID unresolved";
    it is
    "exact UUID resolved, and the local DB already contains concrete physics
    content the earlier chat undercounted".
  - Reopened the implementation-control surface with two bounded worker lanes:
    empirical/program surface packaging,
    and a broader consumer for
    `ObservableSignaturePressureReport`.
  - Landed both bounded implementation slices.
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftObservableSignaturePressureConsumer.agda`
    now re-exposes the held/control pressure report through a repo-facing
    consumer, and
    `scripts/hepdata_program_surface.py`
    now promotes one validated HEPData measurement/report path into the named
    empirical program surface without crossing the deferred
    `MeasurementSurface -> DashiStateSchema` boundary.
  Validation:
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftObservableSignaturePressureConsumer.agda`: pass
  - `pytest tests/test_hepdata_bridge.py`: pass
  - `python scripts/hepdata_program_surface.py --help`: pass
  - `timeout 30s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124`
    with no type error emitted before the bound.
  - Designed the next theorem-thin unifying surface as
    `DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamics.agda`.
    It binds the dynamics-facing interface slots to the current packaged
    empirical validation and pressure-consumer carriers, while keeping the
    boundary explicit that this is interface packaging rather than a new
    derivation claim.
  - Instantiated that interface minimally in
    `DASHI/Physics/DashiDynamicsShiftInstance.agda`
    over the existing shift pressure-point carrier and the packaged
    photonuclear validation surface.

- 2026-03-25: Post-checklist closure runway opened after the Lemma A/B
  strengthening pass landed in `CausalForcesLorentz31`.
  - Reset repo control state from “milestones complete” to a broader active
    parallel runway.
  - Split the remaining work into bounded worker lanes:
    signature/causal hardening, dynamics-status + witness threading,
    concrete constraint/algebraic closure, and known-limits consumer uplift.
  - Tightened the orchestration policy against unbounded/heavy Agda checks
    during worker exploration and killed stray long-running validation.

- 2026-03-25: Refreshed closure label registry and project memory to match the
  current canonical spine (split/parallelogram route through spin/Dirac and
  PhysicsClosureFull). Marked the PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed path as
  legacy/experimental-only in TODO/ClosurePipeline, reclassified
  `QuadraticFromProjection` as `alternative`, and set the next action to the
  constructive Lemma A/B strengthening pass.
- 2026-03-25: Applied `zkp-problem-framing`, `get-shit-done`, and
  `autonomous-orchestrator` to the remaining closure backlog.
  - Added `Docs/AutonomousOrchestratorClosureFrame.md` as the durable
    orchestration/frame note for the current repo phase.
  - Normalized `status.json` to the control vocabulary expected by the
    autonomous orchestrator (`docs=ready`, `tests=unknown`) instead of the
    previous stale/noncanonical values.
  - Explicit routing result:
    use `autonomous-orchestrator` as the control plane and
    `long-running-development` as the next child skill against
    `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`.
  - Guardrail reaffirmed:
    keep `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and full `Everything.agda`
    out of routine inner-loop validation.

- 2026-03-14: Changed closure-hygiene runner defaults so routine runs no
  longer spend hours draining aggregate summary targets after the leaf and
  intermediate modules are already green.
  - `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py` now skips learned `heavy` and
    `aggregator` tasks by default and exposes `--include-heavy` as the
    opt-in switch for aggregate integration runs.
  - `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh` now follows the same default/flag
    contract, preventing the Bash entrypoint from drifting from the Python
    runner.
  Validation:
  - `python3 scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py --help`: pass
  - `bash scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh --help`: pass
  - `python3 scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py --discover-modules --class aggregator`:
    pass, no tasks selected
  - `python3 scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py --discover-modules --class aggregator --include-heavy`:
    pass, reports `DASHI/Everything.agda` and
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`
- 2026-03-14: Removed an unnecessary `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`
  dependency from the canonical ladder path.
  - `Canonical/LocalProgramBundle` now takes `closureStatus` directly from
  `CanonicalStageCStatus.canonicalProved` instead of importing the heavy
    validation summary only to read an alias.
  - Removed unused `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` imports from
    `PhysicsClosureSummary` and `Everything` so routine aggregate checks no
    longer force the 9-hour validation surface through the canonical bundle.
  Validation:
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`: pass.
  - `timeout 120s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124`, no type
    errors emitted before timeout.
- 2026-03-12: Completed `PhysicsClosureFull` canonical-derivation consolidation.
  Added `CanonicalExternalInputs` + builder
  `canonicalPhysicsClosureFullFromExternal` in `PhysicsClosureFull`, so
  contraction/quadratic/signature/constraint fields are theorem-derived by
  construction and only external inputs remain caller-supplied.
  Rewired `PhysicsClosureFullInstance` and `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` to
  use the new builder. Added
  `PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage` to bind full closure endpoint with
  canonical Clifford/spin/Dirac/even-wave bridges, and exported this package
  through `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, and
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`.
  Checks passed:
  `PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage`,
  `PhysicsClosureFull`,
  `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`,
  `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull`,
  `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`.
- 2026-03-12: Tightened canonical export surfaces for path-derived constraint
  closure:
  - `CanonicalStageC` now exports
    `canonicalConstraintPathWitness` and
    `canonicalConstraintClosureFromPathTheorem`.
  - `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` now includes
    `constraintPathWitnessSummary` and
    `constraintClosureFromPathSummary`.
  - `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` now includes
    `constraintPathWitness` and
    `constraintClosureFromPath`.
  Targeted checks passed:
  `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`.
- 2026-03-12: Completed the constraint-path cycle break and switched instance
  surfaces to path-derived closure:
  - Reworked `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem` to use a lightweight
    `CanonicalPathWitness` (`ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` +
    `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`) instead of importing
    `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` directly.
  - Switched
    `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`,
    `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull`,
    and `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed`
    to consume `canonicalPathInducedConstraintClosure`.
  - `CanonicalConstraintClosureWitness` remains path-derived.
  Checks:
  `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem`,
  `CanonicalConstraintClosureWitness`,
  `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` pass.
  `CanonicalStageC` reaches long-run path and times out under bounded check
  (`timeout 90s`, exit `124`) with no type errors emitted.
- 2026-03-12: Continued item 12/13/14 implementation with constraint/law
  surface hardening:
  - `CanonicalConstraintClosureWitness.closureWitness` now points to
    `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem.canonicalPathInducedConstraintClosure`
    (path-derived witness layer).
  - Kept full/assumed closure instances on
    `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPackage.canonicalPackageInducedClosure`
    to avoid an import cycle caused by path theorem dependencies.
  - Added explicit law-status registry in `AxiomSet`
    (`LawStatus`, `AxiomLawSurfaceStatus`,
    `canonicalAxiomLawSurfaceStatus`) for canonical theorem/instance/assumption
    auditing.
  Validation:
  - `CanonicalStageC`: pass.
  - `Everything`: timed check hits runtime guardrail path
    (`PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) and exits `124` under 20s timeout.
- 2026-03-12: Started checklist item 12/13 derivation pass by threading
  canonical theorem-chain outputs into full-closure adapters:
  - `PhysicsClosureFull` now exports canonical bridge helpers
    (`canonicalContractionQuadraticTheorem`,
    `canonicalContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridge`).
  - `PhysicsClosureFullInstance` now takes `quadraticFormZ` from
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.derivedQuadratic` and takes
    `signature31Theorem`/`signature31` from
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
  - `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` was rewired the same way.
  - `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` now consumes
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.signature31Theorem` on the
    canonical route instead of direct profile theorem symbol wiring.
  Validation passed, including a heavy check of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageC.agda`.
- 2026-03-12: Completed checklist item 9 (`DecimationToClifford`) by replacing
  abstract placeholders with explicit theorem interfaces:
  `CliffordRelations.rel` now states generator-square collapse from
  `Quadratic.Q` witnesses; added `TargetAlgebra`,
  `RelationRespectingMap`, and a stronger `UniversalClifford` carrying
  `include`, `factor`, `factorOnInclude`, and uniqueness seam fields.
  Updated `decimation⇒clifford` to construct this richer package.
  Targeted checks passed:
  `DecimationToClifford`,
  `UnificationClosure`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-12: Continued checklist execution for profile/signature selection
  front door hardening. Added constructor/symmetry helpers to
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfile`, introduced a canonical single-source
  profile pipeline record in `OrbitProfileExternal`
  (`CanonicalOrbitProfilePipeline` + canonical equalities), and rewired
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfileShiftInstance` to consume that pipeline and
  expose `shiftSignatureForced31` (signature uniqueness from measured profile
  equality). Targeted checks passed:
  `OrbitProfileExternal`,
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfile`,
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfileShiftInstance`,
  `Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-12: Began implementation execution from
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md` (Phase 1 hardening).
  Added representation-invariance/canonicality lemmas to
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`
  (`canonicalQuadraticAgreement`,
  `canonicalQuadraticAgreementToQ̂core`), added an explicit canonical
  output surface in `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`
  (`CanonicalQuadraticOutput`, `canonicalOutput`, `canonicalOutputAgreement`,
  `canonicalRealStackContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`), and threaded the
  canonical theorem object into
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
  Targeted checks passed:
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-12: Ran `get-shit-done` planning pass to convert the current
  all_code54-based closure roadmap into an execution-ready, module-mapped
  checklist with concrete theorem identifiers. Added
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md` and synchronized project
  memory (`plan.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`) to route next execution to
  `long-running-development` on that checklist.
- 2026-03-12: Tightened `Quadratic ⇒ Signature` from value witness to theorem
  lock by extending `CausalForcesLorentz31` with `LorentzSignatureLock`
  (witness/uniqueness/rival-rejection split), adding
  `lorentzSignatureLockFromCausalAxioms`, and threading theorem-bearing
  signature fields (`signature31Theorem`) through
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and `PhysicsClosureFull`.
- 2026-03-12: Strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` by replacing
  the raw universal seam placeholder with an explicit factorization interface
  (`TargetCarrier`, `factor`, and generator-compatibility witness). Rechecked
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`, and
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` successfully.
- 2026-03-12: Completed the local cleanup of
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda` by replacing
  passthrough dependencies on `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms` with direct local
  proofs for `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits`.
- 2026-03-12: Audited quadratic=>signature theorem dependencies and removed
  the remaining hidden profile prerequisite from intrinsic theorem
  construction by splitting
  `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` into
  core theorem axioms (`IntrinsicSignatureCoreAxioms`) and a separate
  profile witness package (`IntrinsicProfileWitness`), then rewiring
  `Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance` to supply those independently.
- 2026-03-11: Completed canonical `WaveLift⇒Even` bridge hardening as a
  downstream theorem from `Quadratic⇒Clifford`:
  - strengthened `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` with
    `CliffordGrading`, structural `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical `WaveLift`, and
    witness-bearing `WaveLiftIntoEven` factorization (`Σ e, lift s ≡ incl e`).
  - rewired `DASHI/Physics/ConcreteClosureStack.agda` so `q2cl` provides
    canonical multiplication/paired-word structure and `wl` provides
    grading/even/wave-lift/factorization witnesses by construction.
  - added
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda` as the
    dedicated canonical export for the
    `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`
    chain.
  - resolved one import-cycle regression by keeping
    `DASHI/Physics/WaveLiftEvenSubalgebra.agda` prototype-only and placing
    canonical closure exports in the new closure theorem module.
  - targeted checks passed:
    `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
    `ConcreteClosureStack`,
    `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
    `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
    `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-11: Completed quadratic=>signature theorem-source hardening by adding
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda` (causal package + normalization
  seam + Lemma A/Lemma B split), rewiring
  `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` to use that theorem path as primary,
  keeping orbit-profile equality as a secondary certification surface, and
  preserving `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` consumer interface
  unchanged.
- 2026-03-11: Added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` as a
  canonical contraction-strong quadratic-to-Clifford theorem surface.
  It now carries normalized quadratic transport from
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`,
  a canonical bilinear-form builder from normalized quadratic data,
  a theorem-level `Quadratic⇒Clifford` builder, and an explicit
  universal-property seam.
  Also rewired
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` to export the new theorem
  package.
- 2026-03-11: Completed the contraction=>quadratic tightening pass on the
  canonical path by adding
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`, routing
  both `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` through its canonical projection-defect
  package, and extending `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with explicit
  strength fields (`invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`,
  `compatibleWithIsotropy`) while keeping the signature bridge interface
  unchanged.
- 2026-03-11: Added
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem` and threaded it through
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and
  `Everything`. This makes the contraction→signature seam consumable directly
  by spin/Lorentz and spin/Dirac surfaces without changing theorem strength.
- 2026-03-11: Ran targeted checks under a strict 2-minute timeout policy:
  the new bridge module typechecks; Stage-C bundle scope checks time out due to
  large dependency expansion (exit `124`) with no emitted type errors before
  timeout. Runtime guardrail on full
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` checks remains in force.
- 2026-03-11: Completed focused audit of orchestrator-generated edits and
  adopted them as baseline where compile-safe and aligned with the bottleneck
  path (notably Bool inversion witness + standalone B₄ snap-threshold harness).
  Kept `milestones_remaining = 1` because `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` is still open.
- 2026-03-11: Completed the cross-realization snap-threshold extension by
  adding a Bool inversion-specific witness module
  (`Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness`), rewiring
  `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` to consume it, adding a standalone
  `SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4` harness, and exporting the new B₄ verdict
  through `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`.
- 2026-03-11: Added
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` and exported it through
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, and `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`.
  This makes the strengthened contraction path a first-class signature bridge
  surface while keeping uniqueness-up-to-scale explicitly pending.
- 2026-03-11: Added a runtime guardrail note in project memory to skip
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` routine checks until runtime bounds
  are acceptable; current observed bound is ~1.25h.
- 2026-03-11: Exported a canonical nontrivial strengthened contraction witness
  across Stage C surfaces (`CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) via
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.canonicalNontrivialInvariantStrong`.
- 2026-03-11: Ran autonomous orchestrator once; it selected
  `long-running-development` and exited with code `1` due blocked network
  access to `chatgpt.com` Codex/MCP endpoints in this environment.
- 2026-03-11: Added `canonicalSignedPerm4InvariantStrong` in
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`, wiring the first nontrivial quadratic
  invariant witness (`Signature31InstanceShiftZ.qcore-pres4`) through the
  strengthened contraction path.
- 2026-03-11: Strengthened `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with a concrete
  invariant witness field (`invariantQuadraticWitness`) and added
  `canonicalIdentityInvariantStrong` as the first non-placeholder witness
  instance while keeping `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` explicitly open.
- 2026-03-10: Re-baselined Stage-C status after audit: downgraded the previous
  "five-pillar complete" wording to "packaging complete, bottleneck proof
  still open". Added two bottleneck modules:
  `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram` and
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`, where the remaining
  invariant/uniqueness obligations are explicit seams.
- 2026-03-10: Added `PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem` and threaded it through
  canonical Stage C exports (`CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, and `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) so the
  five target milestones are represented as one explicit theorem package:
  natural dynamics law, conserved quantity, continuum limit,
  realization-independent proof, and full gauge/matter recovery theorem.
- 2026-03-10: Replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness with a synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`, proxy policy), rewired `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` and `Everything` to consume it, and updated plan/TODO/status/docs to track the cross-realization validation package as in progress.
- 2026-03-10: Added a synthetic one-minus non-shift snap policy derived from the witness state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the shift snap witness), updated validation exports, and retargeted the next snap-threshold step to the Bool inversion witness + B₄ harness.
- 2026-03-10: Bug-hunter cycle: reproduced `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` failure (exit 42), fixed exported alias collisions in wave-regime consumers (`KLRWOTGRC`, `KLRWOTGRCOMP`) by making them private, then fixed a `rigidityAggregate` multiple-definition collision in `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` by switching `RealizationProfileRigidityShift` to a qualified import; targeted scope-check now passes, while full typechecks were cut short by runtime limits in this environment.
- 2026-03-10: Added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a provisional non-shift validation placeholder.
- 2026-03-10: Documented the condensed priority roadmap and the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite so the next validation step is explicit.
- 2026-03-10: Fixed a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open import and keeping explicit aliases; kicked off a recheck of the module.
- 2026-03-10: Expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and added a tertiary snap-threshold harness wired into the validation summary.
- 2026-03-10: Added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- 2026-03-10: Added preferred harness/dataset column to the forward prediction validation table and marked the TODO item complete.
- 2026-03-10: Extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the shift reference with a secondary shift-side boundary case, wired the verdict into the validation summary, and refreshed docs/plan/TODO/status/changelog.
- 2026-03-10: Added a falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report (mirror-signature exclusion and competing 4D profile failures) and wired the shift verdict into the validation summary; refreshed plan/status/TODO/docs.
- 2026-03-10: Added canonical dynamics law, local causal theorems, and export wiring plus documentation updates to keep the Stage C summary accurate.
- 2026-03-10: Repo auditor confirmed canonical Stage C now exports dynamics and known-limits surfaces per the new spec/architecture, and the summary bundle references the refreshed theorems.
- 2026-03-10: Added KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem and re-exported it through the GR/QFT bridges so the canonical Stage C ladder now has a theorem-backed completion path for both gauge/matter and GR/QFT.
- 2026-03-10: Rewired canonical Stage C imports to use the grouped wave-regime wrappers and marked the TODO consolidation item complete.
- 2026-03-10: Rewired canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers to use recovery wave-regime wrappers; added a profile-rigidity aggregate report and exposed it in the validation summary; refreshed plan/TODO/status.
- 2026-03-10: Attempted autonomous orchestrator run; it failed due to blocked network access to the Codex backend.
- 2026-03-10: Added a formalized χ² boundary theorem wrapper and surfaced it in the validation summary; reprioritized TODO toward falsifiability and observable-collapse harness work.
- 2026-03-11: Ran `get-shit-done` planning pass focused on proof-graph simplification. Set a single canonical closure spine (`ProjectionDefect → EnergySplitProof → Parallelogram → QuadraticForm → ConeTimeIsotropy → Signature31FromConeArrowIsotropy → Signature31Lock`), added route classification policy (`canonical` / `alternative` / `validation` / `experimental`), and rerouted project memory to treat parallel quadratic/signature emergence modules as non-canonical derivation checks.
- 2026-03-11: Long-running-development execution pass for the Stage C spine simplification. Updated contraction theorem surfaces to expose projection→parallelogram packages instead of raw emergence axioms (`ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`, `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`), hardened uniqueness transport in `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`, aligned `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` with the updated uniqueness accessor, added explicit non-canonical route annotations to the parallel quadratic modules, and refreshed `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` to the `canonical/alternative/validation/experimental` taxonomy with a canonical `QuadraticForm` node. Targeted Agda checks passed for canonical Stage C and both theorem/summary bundles.
- 2026-03-11: Completed direct Stage C-facing import sweep off `QuadraticFormEmergence` for full-closure adapters. Reworked `PhysicsClosureFull` to accept `ProjectionDefectParallelogramPackage` on `metricEmergence`, and rewired `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull`, and `PhysicsClosureFullShiftInstance` to construct quadratics via `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.quadraticFromProjectionDefect`. Verified with targeted checks plus canonical Stage C + theorem/summary bundles.
- 2026-03-11: Added package-first shift helpers in `QuadraticEmergenceShiftInstance` (`projectionParallelogramShift`, `quadraticShiftΣ`, `quadraticShift`) and rewired `Signature31InstanceShiftZ` to consume them instead of importing `QuadraticFormEmergence` directly. Targeted module checks pass. A full `CanonicalStageC` recheck is currently blocked by an unrelated sort mismatch in `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` (`Set₂` vs `Set₁`).
- 2026-03-11: Completed the canonical import sweep in Stage-C-facing surfaces. Added `DASHI/Geometry/QuadraticCanonical.agda` as a canonical re-export entrypoint; added canonical-boundary comments to projection/quadratic and contraction/signature bridge modules; and confirmed no direct imports of alternate quadratic geometry modules in `Closure`/`Signature`/`Unification` surfaces. Verified `CanonicalStageC` and `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` typecheck after the sweep.
- 2026-03-11: Follow-up compatibility pass after deeper validation-summary rechecks. Restored `localCoherenceSummary` in `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and rewired it from canonical local-coherence theorem surface; renamed `SignatureClassificationBridge.Signature` to `SignatureClassification` to resolve namespace ambiguity; propagated that rename into `CanonicalContractionQuadraticSignatureBridgeTheorem`; rechecked canonical Stage C + theorem/summary bundles successfully. `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` now progresses past prior scope failures but still exceeds a 300s bounded run.
## 2026-04-28

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` for
  `69f03090-b914-8398-b672-4424926a104c`.
  The canonical pull succeeded, but the resolver still missed on UUID-first
  lookup in the merged archive shape, so the effective content recovery came
  from the skill troubleshooting path
  `python -m re_gpt.cli --view`.
  Recovered thread:
  `Pressure Dynamics and Action`.
  A follow-on title-exact resolver pass then recovered the canonical thread
  ID from DB as
  `e02fe1b902e868c01ccf15ed72d6473b97fb96d2`.
- Landed a bounded variational bridge package rather than widening the
  Schrödinger surface again:
  `PressureHamiltonJacobiGap.agda`
  and
  `PressureHamiltonJacobiShiftInstance.agda`.
  The new seam records that the repo now has an explicit
  `pressure -> least action -> Bellman/Hamilton-Jacobi presentation`
  package over the existing three-point shift carrier, still with explicit
  non-claim boundaries around any continuous-limit or Schrödinger reading.
- Strengthened the next layer down immediately after that:
  `DashiDynamicsShiftInstance`
  reduction is no longer only reflexive packaging;
  it now carries an explicit held-point fixed point together with a bounded
  potential-descent witness.
  Theorem-thin consumers for that seam now live at
  `PressureGradientFlowGap.agda`
  and
  `PressureGradientFlowShiftInstance.agda`.
- Tightened that same seam further:
  `DashiDynamicsShiftInstance`
  now also exposes strict potential descent on the explicit non-held slice of
  the current three-point carrier, and the gradient-flow consumer lane
  mirrors that stricter witness without widening the theorem claim boundary.
- Continued that same bounded lane instead of returning to wave lift:
  `DashiDynamicsShiftInstance`
  now carries a constructive convergence theorem to
  `shiftHeldExitPoint`
  together with an explicit `≤ 2` step bound on the current three-point
  carrier.
  Added
  `DASHI/Physics/ShiftPotentialQuadraticEnergy.agda`
  as the finite scalar quadratic-energy package induced by
  `shiftHeldPotential`, proving monotone descent of
  `Q(s) = shiftHeldPotential(s)^2`
  under `shiftPressureAdvance`.
  This was recorded explicitly as a local energy surface rather than a claim
  that the full canonical quadratic-form lane had already been re-derived
  from pressure dynamics.
- Packaged the finite terminality facts separately instead of mutating the
  lower gradient-flow interface again:
  `PressureGradientFlowTerminalityGap.agda`
  and
  `PressureGradientFlowTerminalityShiftInstance.agda`
  now package eventual held-entry, bounded `≤ 2` convergence, unique fixed
  point, and unique zero-potential point on the current three-point carrier.
  This keeps the attractor reading explicit and finite-carrier-scoped without
  promoting it to a general dynamical-systems theorem.
- Connected the finite pressure-induced energy surface into the repo's
  quadratic interface layer without overclaiming theorem status:
  `ShiftPotentialQuadraticBridge.agda`
  packages
  `ShiftPotentialQuadraticEnergy`
  as a local
  `ContractionQuadraticBridge.QuadraticOutput`-compatible object, with an
  explicit boundary that this is a finite local handoff rather than a
  re-derivation of the canonical contraction=>quadratic theorem chain.
- Added the next bounded bilinear-facing seam on top of that local handoff:
  `ShiftPotentialBilinearBridge.agda`
  exposes one explicit symmetric pair form on the finite shift carrier whose
  diagonal matches the pressure-induced quadratic energy exactly.
  This was recorded explicitly as a local bilinear-style bridge, not a full
  polarization theorem or vector-space upgrade.
- Related that same seam to the repo's existing Clifford-gate metric
  interface:
  `ShiftPotentialCliffordMetric.agda`
  packages the finite bilinear form as a
  `CliffordGate.BilinearForm`
  together with a `RingLike ℤ` carrier and an exact diagonal recovery theorem,
  but intentionally stops short of constructing a Clifford algebra.
- Started the upward wave lift in parallel with that lower relation:
  `SchrodingerGapPhaseWaveShiftInstance.agda`
  adds a second Schrödinger-gap inhabitant whose `WaveState` is a structured
  `carrier + amplitude + phase` record rather than the raw pressure point
  alone, and its witness surface now packages density monotonicity,
  amplitude monotonicity, and phase descent together.
- Extended that same structured carrier with the first bounded interference /
  phase-transport law:
  exact conservation of `amplitude + phase` under one finite advance step.
  Added
  `ShiftPhaseWaveContinuumStory.agda`
  as the finite continuum-style packaging layer over that structured carrier,
  with a bounded transport coordinate,
  conserved interference charge,
  and exact coordinate/phase balance law,
  while keeping explicit no-PDE / no-scaling-limit boundaries.
- Implemented the bounded observation-and-transport integration tranche:
  - `DASHI/Biology/RetinalPerturbationObservationBridge.agda` now packages the
    avian compass to retinal perturbation to perceptual quotient join, with
    explicit no-qualia and no-brain-closure boundaries.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BidirectionalBrainObservationQuotient.agda` now
    localizes the brain/body quotient surface over fMRI, percept, behavior,
    and whole-body resource readouts, with joint narrowing but no latent-state
    recovery.
  - `DASHI/Interop/SeaMeInItROMKernelFormalism.agda` now records the
    SeaMeInIt body/basis/ROM/projected-field/seam/panel/manufacturing receipt
    pipeline with tri-valued gates and coupling debt.
  - `DASHI/Interop/ObservationTransportSpine.agda` now names the shared
    carrier -> lossy quotient -> admissibility -> transport -> promotion
    spine used to keep the joins non-collapsing.
- Pulled and resolved the `Quantum Mechanism in Birds` thread
  (`6a09e6c0-2cb8-83ec-b3de-6fcb9433f5f7`,
  canonical `6d744bfcd774a11523de7beb4c5cf534f617e034`) and discharged the
  remaining animal-sense surfaces:
  - `DASHI/Biology/GenomeSensorimotorConnectomeBridge.agda` gives the
    DNA/regulation/morphogenesis -> retina/optic/brain/body connectome
    constraint bridge, explicitly not DNA-meaning or qualia closure.
  - `DASHI/Biology/AnimalexicAnimalUtteranceSurface.agda` treats animal
    utterance as multimodal evidence for a latent body/social state, blocking
    sound->word, direct qualia, and receiptless promotion routes.
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SensoryAttractorClasses.agda` and
    `DASHI/Biology/EvolvedSensoryTransport.agda` package generalized sensory
    transport into low-dimensional attractor/behavior quotients with
    evolutionary retention only under explicit receipts.
  - `DASHI/Biology/AnimalSenseObservationThreadDischarge.agda` ties the fetched
    thread's avian, genome, Animalexic, sensory-attractor, brain/body,
    SeaMeInIt ROM, and observation-spine surfaces into one non-promoting
    discharge witness.
- Refreshed the same `Quantum Mechanism in Birds` thread on 2026-05-19 and
  confirmed the archived tail remains at 71 messages. The new tail content on
  all-senses Kluever-style attractors and evolutionary retention is already
  covered by `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SensoryAttractorClasses.agda` and
  `DASHI/Biology/EvolvedSensoryTransport.agda`.
- Added the follow-up light transport / codec discharge surfaces:
  - `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LightTransportFibreClosure.agda` records rendering
    as scene/viewport -> photon-or-pixel carrier -> geometry/material/spectral/
    visibility fibres -> closure receipt -> lit viewport, with explicit
    no-global-`O(1)` and no-hidden-residual boundaries.
  - `DASHI/Combinatorics/TriadicVideoCodecObservationQuotient.agda` records
    frame stream -> predictor chart -> signed residual -> balanced ternary
    planes -> reuse quotient -> entropy payload -> deterministic decode,
    requiring side information and equality/correction evidence.
  - `DASHI/Interop/LightCodecTransportDischarge.agda` ties the two as an
    analogy-only latent-transform/reuse discipline, not an identity claim.
- Added the BioAnimalexic stack integration tranche:
  - `DASHI/Biology/CellDifferentiationCommunicationBridge.agda` now makes the
    previously implicit cell communication / metabolism / circulation /
    endocrine / immune lane explicit, with toy observation, candidate,
    receipt, meaning, and guard-certificate inhabitants.
  - `DASHI/Biology/EmbodiedMotorMultisensoryBridge.agda` now records motor
    control, nociception as pain-behaviour class, proprioception, vestibular
    readout, multisensory body estimate, and behaviour-envelope constraints,
    with toy inhabitants and explicit intent / pain-qualia / motor-policy /
    sensor-fusion blockers.
  - `DASHI/Biology/CrossSpeciesOntologyTranslationBridge.agda` records the
    Animalexic/WikiSpecies path through social, ecological, memory, taxon, and
    ontology context, with projection residuals and no qualia-identity,
    species-isomorphism, anthropomorphic-promotion, or context-free
    translation claim.
  - `DASHI/Biology/BioAnimalexicStackDischarge.agda` ties the three surfaces
    into an inhabited, aggregate, non-promoting stack discharge and
    `DASHI/Everything.agda` imports the new biology surfaces.
- Refreshed the same `Quantum Mechanism in Birds` thread again on 2026-05-19
  (`6a09e6c0-2cb8-83ec-b3de-6fcb9433f5f7`, canonical
  `6d744bfcd774a11523de7beb4c5cf534f617e034`; latest archived turn
  `2026-05-19T03:20:03Z`) and discharged the new bidirectional ontology /
  computation tail:
  - `DASHI/Computation/PersistentTransportMotifs.agda` records program,
    renderer, database, codec, physics-engine, compiler, network-stack, and
    spreadsheet execution as a non-promoting persistent typed fibre fabric over
    load/fetch, transport, mix/transform, compare, mask/gate, branch, shuffle,
    accumulate/reduce, store/commit, synchronize, and dispatch motifs.
  - `DASHI/Ontology/WikidataAnimalSemanticJoinLayer.agda` records
    Wikidata/Wikipedia/WikiSpecies as a public review join for Animalexic
    candidates, with no edit authority, truth authority, blind edit, qualia
    identity, context-free translation, or anthropomorphic promotion.
  - `DASHI/Interop/AggregateBidirectionalTranslationDischarge.agda` records the
    human <-> dog <-> octopus <-> alien <-> renderer <-> machine chain,
    imports the computation motif and semantic-join certificates, and blocks
    universal-translator, zero-defect, qualia-identity, and runtime-optimizer
    promotion while preserving projection defects.
- Refreshed the same `Quantum Mechanism in Birds` thread again on 2026-05-19;
  the live pull inserted `315` messages and advanced the latest archived turn
  to `2026-05-19T04:50:20Z`.  Discharged the new observer/culture/evolution
  tail:
  - `DASHI/Biology/EvolutionaryTransportMDLBridge.agda` records conserved
    molecular machinery and evolution as bounded MDL-guided persistent
    transport motifs, without abiogenesis, origin-of-life closure, biology
    inevitability, or optimizer promotion.
  - `DASHI/Reasoning/MultiObserverScienceQuotient.agda` records latent carrier
    observation through many-to-one quotients, apparent randomness, and
    peer-review/replication as residual-gated multi-observer fusion, without
    determinism, hidden-variable, truth-closure, or latent-recovery promotion.
  - `DASHI/Reasoning/FreeWillAdmissibleBranchPNF.agda` records free-will
    language as observer-local branch navigation with PNF/population fusion
    and bidirectional choice/world constraints, without metaphysical proof,
    intent recovery, fantasy promotion, or branch enumeration completeness.
  - `DASHI/Culture/InverseBidirectionalCultureOperators.agda` records fiction,
    nonfiction, reading aloud, art, architecture, poetry, politics, and
    WAIS/autism-style probes as bounded inverse cultural operators/quotients,
    without clinical, WAIS-authority, culture-determinism, qualia, child
    development, or aesthetic-truth promotion.
  - `DASHI/Interop/ObserverCultureEvolutionThreadDischarge.agda` links the four
    surfaces into a single aggregate non-promotion certificate and
    `DASHI/Everything.agda` imports the new tranche.
- Added `DASHI/Culture/KnotWeaveTopologyCultureBridge.agda`, a theorem-thin
  bridge that carries knot, weave, and braid as semantic/topological operator
  roles over the existing inverse-culture surface. The bridge is imported by
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, has its own observation-spine domain, and blocks
  cultural universal, identity/qualia closure, context-free equivalence, and
  authority promotion claims.
- 2026-05-19: Gate 7/8 Higgs transport target advanced without promotion.
  `HiggsSymmetryBreakingReceipt.agda` now exposes
  `canonicalHiggsFiniteToComplexDoubletTransportSurface`, connecting the
  finite vacuum-shell argmin precursor to the symbolic complex-doublet
  norm/order ledger and symbolic norm-squared link. Targeted Agda checks pass
  for `HiggsSymmetryBreakingReceipt.agda` and `CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda`.
  This earlier entry was later advanced by
  `canonicalHiggsHermitianNormSquaredTransportLaw`; finite-order reflection
  into the actual carrier order, completed-square lift, residual `U1_EM`, W4
  `v_Higgs`, CKM/Yukawa arithmetic, and Gate 8 terminal receipt remain open.
- 2026-05-21: lower6 orchestrated and collected the requested 18-lane bounded
  implementation wave.  Accepted patches stay non-promoting and cover YM
  finite trace/Ad probes, GR finite-R/stress-energy staging, AQFT/GNS/DHR
  blocker packaging, FactorVec-to-Yukawa and CKM ledger staging, terminal
  six-postulate/Candidate256 fail-closed ledgering, and u6 selected
  foreign-identity eliminators.  Coordinator repaired the post-return
  `CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda` nested assembly proof mismatch.  Targeted
  Agda passes include the touched YM, GR, DHR, CKM, S8, W4 calibration,
  and balanced-trit surfaces; `DASHI/Everything.agda` still exits
  124 under the 30s policy and remains inconclusive.
- 2026-05-21: lower6 Gate2/Stone/authority/dispersion follow-up added
  non-promoting real/non-Nat S8 carrier staging, self-adjoint/Hamiltonian
  blocker receipt, Candidate256 external calibration gate wiring, and formal
  Nat `E0 = m c^2` dispersion surfaces.  The terminal boundary now exposes
  `Lower6GateReceiptWiringLedger` with bounded Stone blocker wiring and
  `terminalClaimPromoted = false`.  Targeted Agda passes for the touched S8,
  W4, and balanced-trit modules; the terminal check currently stops in
  imported QFT dependencies before reaching the new ledger, with observed
  blockers in `AQFTCarrierAlgebraQuotientSurface.agda`
  (`RestrictedCarrierSocket` / `RestrictedCarrier`) and
  `DHRGaugeReceiptSurface.agda` (`Setω != Set` at
  `DRH1SymmetricTensorStarCategory`).
- 2026-05-21: Gate 1-4 orchestrator sweep assigned four read-only verification
  workers after the consolidated frontier request.  The sweep found no
  locally completable theorem queue: Gate 1 still needs AQFT/DHR
  carrier-functor semantics, Gate 2 still needs the external
  `UniformBalaban-or-AgawaIRFixedPoint` input for the real S8 Hamiltonian and
  spectral lower bound, Gate 3 still needs real user-supplied YM/SU3/Hodge
  carriers beyond finite `Phase4`/`Lie3` staging, and Gate 4 still needs a
  selected metric-compatibility repair plus W4/Candidate256 matter
  stress-energy semantics.  No theorem modules were edited; the result is an
  honest halt, not a promotion.
- 2026-05-21: authority-token wave assigned five read-only workers for the
  proposed semantic/external unlocks.  The repo types reject the shortcut
  classification: `vHiggsAdapter4Boundary` is retained with physical
  promotion false; Candidate256 and W4 stress-energy receipts require
  constructorless accepted-DY / calibration / adequacy authorities and prove
  local impossibility; `cStarCompletion` is an authority socket rather than a
  local Banach/C-star construction; `BisognanoWichmann` is citation-shaped but
  still blocks at `missingTomitaOperator`; and `DoplicherRoberts` has H1-H5
  staging records while reconstruction, compact group, fibre functor, and SM
  matching remain false.  No theorem files were edited.  The wave closes as a
  hard semantic/authority halt, with only diagnostic ledger hardening locally
  available.

- 2026-05-21: middle6 assigned and collected the downstream-after-five-blockers
  wave. Workers added fail-closed target receipts for Gate 2 Friedrichs and
  continuum transport, Gate 3 Hodge variation and SFGC IBP, Gate 4 sourced
  Einstein, Gate 5 Tomita/Stone physical Hamiltonian, Gate 6 tensor/statistics/
  hexagon/DR reconstruction, and Gate 7 physical Yukawa/DHR intertwiner
  surfaces. The coordinator wired these into
  `canonicalMiddle6DownstreamAfterFiveBlockersLedger` and kept all Gate 8
  theorem flags plus `terminalClaimPromoted` false.

- 2026-05-21: middle6 assigned and collected the first-missing hard-math
  iteration. Workers landed fail-closed receipts for canonical finite Casimir
  gap-one modes, the strict YM non-flat curvature type mismatch, a
  Christoffel-aware doubled-`2Γ` GR input with finite `4R`/Ricci/scalar/`2G`
  bookkeeping, scoped AQFT/GNS quotient descent, DHR identity-action semantic
  adapter dependencies, and Gaussian-rational CKM CP-phase/Jarlskog
  bookkeeping. The coordinator wired these into
  `canonicalMiddle6FirstMissingHardMathIterationLedger`; `terminalClaimPromoted`
  and all external/physical/DR/SM promotions remain false.

- 2026-05-21: middle6 assigned and collected the Schrödinger-clock
  hard-blocker tranche. Worker returns were integrated across YM, GR, AQFT/GNS,
  DHR, and CKM surfaces. The coordinator repaired GR Bianchi witness
  orientation, lifted the Ricci sourced-Einstein surface to the required
  universe, replaced stale terminal projections, and updated terminal ledgers
  to reflect that selected metric compatibility now advances while
  Levi-Civita remains open. Targeted GR/YM/QFT checks pass, terminal
  composition passes, and `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 under 300s. No
  terminal, Clay, W4/W5, Candidate256, Doplicher-Roberts, Standard Model,
  physical Yukawa, exact CKM, or continuum mass-gap promotion was made.
- 2026-05-21: upper6 assigned and completed the requested upper/middle/lower
  reissue wave. Landed fail-closed receipt threading for finite lower YM
  holonomy and `D_A^2` probes, selected doubled-Christoffel torsion-free
  Levi-Civita inspection, finite trace-state Cauchy-Schwarz missing-law audit,
  approximate `Q[i]` CKM unitarity/Jarlskog bookkeeping, DHR
  `EndomorphismActionData` semantic-adapter missing-field audit, downstream
  YM/GR/GNS/Stone/DHR/CKM ledgers, and the terminal upper6 collection monitor.
  A transient CKM exact-unitarity rejection proof mismatch was repaired by the
  downstream CKM worker before final validation. Targeted YM, GR, QFT, DHR,
  CKM, Stone, AQFT, terminal checks pass; `DASHI/Everything.agda` exits 0 under
  300s; `git diff --check` and the forbidden true-promotion grep are clean.
  All requested lanes remain non-promoting: strict non-flat YM curvature/Lie/
  transport/variation, selected Levi-Civita, finite trace-state positivity/CS,
  DHR local-algebra action laws, exact CKM/Jarlskog, Gate 8, and terminal
  promotion are still blocked by the recorded exact primitives.

- 2026-05-27: Paper7 inventory wave assigned across six workers and integrated
  with honest promotion boundaries.  A1 landed
  `CarrierFunctorPrimeLaneLaws.agda`, inhabiting bounded p2/p3/p5/p7 carrier
  functor laws via existing graph-functor and FactorVec commutation surfaces.
  A2/A3 added `DHRCategoryDRSMIdentificationFailClosedReceipt` and threaded it
  through `DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction`, preserving the missing local DR
  category laws, symmetric tensor/hexagon, DR authority consumption, compact
  group, and exact SM match blockers.  B1 added a finite nonzero curvature
  receipt in `Depth9ConnectionAndCurvature.agda` using the SFGCSite2D
  reference plaquette where curvature evaluates to `φ1` and is not vacuum
  `φ0`.  B2/B3 added `ChainB2B3YMEinsteinCompatibilityReceipt`, composing the
  Gate 4 YM stress-energy substitution and GR compatibility surfaces while
  keeping sourced Einstein and `T_YM = T_GR` unpromoted.  C1 added
  `PenguinDecayLHCbChecksumAcceptedResidualReceipt.agda`, binding the LHCb CDS
  supplementary ZIP SHA256
  `68bf6ab48ca104c2e37f1edeb64fbde59d4542600adf78c28869f092daef7fb8` while
  explicitly not constructing a HEPData table receipt or accepted residual.
  The information-paradox obstruction is now an arXiv:2507.17031v1-anchored
  typed cross-gate receipt, not a resolution theorem.  Targeted checks,
  `CrossGateConsistency`, `InformationParadoxCrossGateObstruction`,
  `DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction`, `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and
  `git diff --check` pass.  Paper7/Gate8 remains fail-closed rather than
  promoted.

- 2026-05-27: prediction-frontier continuation landed the next typed targets
  without promoting unconstructed physics.  YM mass-gap receipts now thread
  finite positive evidence, the withdrawn 5D constructive route audit,
  topological interpretation blockers, colimit/Hamiltonian lift blockers, and
  the continuum Clay obligation; reflection positivity, polymer-cluster
  convergence, OS reconstruction, physical Hamiltonian spectral lift, and Clay
  acceptance remain false.  DHR/SM now records finite p2/p3/p5 matrix targets
  `C`, `M2`, and `M3` in `FinitePrimeLaneDHRSMCompatibilityLedger`, but actual
  DHR end-sector algebras, DR compact group reconstruction, and
  `G_DHR ~= G_SM` remain false.  `CarrierYukawaRatioTargetReceipt`,
  `CKMPredictionFrontierReceipt`, and
  `PenguinDecayC9C10P5PrimePredictionTargetReceipt` name the first real
  prediction targets while keeping physical-Yukawa, exact CKM/CP, Wilson
  authority, LHCb table, residual-vector, and anomaly-claim promotions false.
  The information-paradox surface also records dark-sector, Planck-cutoff, and
  Page-curve frontier targets with quantum-gravity promotion false.  Targeted
  checks and `DASHI/Everything.agda` pass; `git diff --check` remains clean.

- 2026-05-28: Documentation/status-only prediction-frontier sync.  Recorded
  a withdrawn 5D constructive YM route as non-promoting evidence only; no
  YM/Clay route is promoted from it.  Re-stated the Gate 5 penguin blocker as the selected LHCb
  table/checksum plus freeze-tuple gap, with the 2025 full Run 1+2
  `LHCb-PAPER-2025-041` / `arXiv:2512.18053` / `CDS:2951844` result as the
  current public target, the 2020 `HEPData:ins1798504` result as fallback-only,
  and `HEPData 160745` as mismatch/fail-closed unless P5' table binding is
  proved.  The Gate 6 DHR/SM next target remains
  finite end-sector computation rather than endomorphism-algebra or DR
  reconstruction closure.  `C9/P5'` remains a non-promoting prediction target
  gated by Wilson authority, selected LHCb data, residual-vector construction,
  and anomaly-claim promotion false.

- 2026-05-28: Implemented the prediction-frontier follow-up while preserving
  fail-closed promotion boundaries.  Gate 5 now records the CERN repository
  route as thesis/value route evidence only and records the direct
  `ins2101841` route as stale negative provenance.  The penguin receipt now
  records the 2025 full Run 1+2 public result as the selected P5'/C9 target,
  records `HEPData:ins1798504` as the stable 2020 fallback route, and rejects
  the supplied `HEPData 160745` / `ins2922449` Table 16 YAML/JSON artifacts as
  b-jet-mass data rather than P5' value/covariance data.  No LHCb
  value/covariance checksum is asserted.  Gate 6
  adds an inhabited finite carrier matrix
  computation receipt for p2 scalar `C`, p3 Clifford/M2 round-trip evidence,
  and p5 W3/M3 clock-shift laws; actual DHR localised endomorphism algebra,
  DR compact-group reconstruction, and `G_DHR ~= G_SM` remain false.  Added
  `PenguinDecayCarrierDerivedC9ConstraintTargetReceipt`, wiring the carrier
  CKM/Yukawa surfaces into the `C9_NP` sign/magnitude target while keeping
  physical C9 derivation, Wilson authority acceptance, empirical constraint,
  and anomaly claim false.  Targeted checks and `DASHI/Everything.agda` pass;
  `git diff --check` is clean.

- 2026-05-28: Manager B Gate 3/4 geometry plus Navier-Stokes regularity
  tranche completed across six lanes.  Gate 3 now has a depth-9 finite carrier
  curvature 2-form over all available SFGCSite2D plaquettes, with the
  reference plaquette computing `φ1`, plus a finite zero-current pure-YM
  `D * F = J` receipt for `J = 0`; strict real SU3/Hodge/YM promotion remains
  false behind the recorded transport and variation blockers.  Gate 4 now has
  `SourcedEinsteinCompatibilityReceipt`, wiring contracted Bianchi divergence
  zero, finite YM stress-energy substitution, and finite zero-table source
  compatibility for the target `G^munu = 8pi T^munu_YM`, while full sourced
  Einstein promotion remains blocked by 8π normalization, coordinate YM
  tensor construction, on-shell YM Noether conservation, and W4 authority.
  Navier-Stokes now has finite-depth local existence with `T_n = suc n`,
  finite-depth L2 energy estimates at every depth, and an explicit finite
  Leray/Hodge projection `P_sigma u = u - grad phi` with
  `Delta phi = div u` and `div(P_sigma u) = 0`; continuum regularity remains
  an explicit obligation.  Targeted Agda checks pass for all six touched
  Manager B modules.

- 2026-05-28: Manager A Gate 6 DHR-SM tranche completed across six lanes.
  The finite p2/p3/p5 end-sector path now has carrier-level localised
  endomorphism star/composition/associativity receipts in
  `FinitePrimeLaneDHRSMCompatibilityLedger`, a finite lane-local endomorphism
  category in `Gate6FinitePrimeLaneLocalEndomorphismCategory`, finite
  conjugate/dual identity-zigzag receipts in
  `FinitePrimeLaneConjugateDualReceipts`, finite tensor target/braiding-swap
  progress in `DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction`, and finite hexagon progress
  in `DHRHexagonObligation` with the exact first missing law recorded as
  braiding naturality.  The DR authority receipt already consumes the five
  internal DHR/DR axiom receipts; DR theorem application, compact gauge-group
  construction, exact SM matching, and `G_DHR ~= G_SM` remain false.  The new
  Gate 6 modules are imported by `DASHI.Everything`; targeted Agda checks,
  `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and `git diff --check` pass.

- 2026-05-28: Gate 6 braiding-naturality tranche completed across six reused
  worker lanes.  `FinitePrimeLaneDHRSMCompatibilityLedger` now exposes finite
  carrier-pair identity arrows, pair swap, and inhabited p2/p3/p5
  pair-swap-braiding naturality receipts.  `DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction`
  consumes the definitional finite square
  `swap (id wire) == id (swap wire)`.  `DHRHexagonObligation` threads that
  receipt into finite hexagon progress, so the exact next finite blocker moves
  from `missingFinitePrimeLaneBraidingNaturalitySquareLaw` to
  `missingFinitePrimeLaneLeftRightHexagonCoherenceLaw`; statistics-as-braiding
  remains a separate residual target.  `DHRGaugeReceiptSurface` threads the
  finite-row naturality availability into the DR axiom/authority receipts while
  preserving DR theorem application, compact gauge-group construction, exact
  SM matching, and `G_DHR ~= G_SM` as false.  Targeted Gate 6 Agda checks and
  `git diff --check` pass.  The exact manuscript-facing phrase
  `no overclaiming, no fake closures` was absent, so no external manuscript
  prose edit was required.

- 2026-05-28: Worker A5 integrated the latest Manager A Gate 6 finite
  hexagon/statistics receipts at the aggregate/status boundary.  The Gate 6
  aggregate imports already include the finite local-endomorphism category and
  finite conjugate/dual modules, while the newer finite left/right hexagon and
  statistics receipts live inside the already-imported
  `DHRHexagonObligation`/`DHRTensorDualGroupReconstruction` surfaces.
  Documentation now says finite naturality, finite left/right hexagon target
  receipts, and finite statistics-as-braiding target receipt are inhabited.
  Arbitrary DHR hexagon closure, statistics-as-braiding in the full DHR
  category, DR theorem application, compact group construction, and
  `G_DHR ~= G_SM` remain fail-closed.

- 2026-05-29: Manager A completed the Paper 1 submission-prep tranche across
  six worker lanes.  Updated `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript`
  in both `.tex` and `.md`: abstract/intro now make \(P_5'\) the lead
  empirical contact, Section 2 reflects finite depth-9 YM curvature and finite
  prime-lane DHR progress, Section 11 records the digest-bound
  `p5PrimeBorderlineAnomalyCandidate` while demoting Drell-Yan to TRBD
  methodology, Section 13 reflects current gate blockers, and Section 14
  indexes the new DHR/NS/Wald/Penguin/CKM/Yukawa/YM/frontier receipts.
  Added `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/ArxivSubmissionChecklist.md`, verified
  arXiv `math-ph` as the primary category against the official taxonomy, and
  rebuilt `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/build/Paper1_Manuscript.pdf` from repo
  root with `latexmk`; no unresolved citations, missing figures, or LaTeX
  errors remain.

- 2026-05-29: Completed the Paper 8 submission-readiness pass.  Six workers
  tightened `Docs/Paper8UnificationDraft.md` around a theorem-box statement of
  the inhabited `MillenniumTowerSchemaReceipt`/instance receipts, added the
  in-manuscript "What This Paper Does Not Claim" section, inserted the honest
  Cabibbo `g12 = 1` diagnostic and `5.5x` PDG discrepancy, and expanded both
  the in-paper and standalone receipt indexes so cited receipts have module
  paths and Agda identifiers.  The final source is Markdown rather than TeX.
  Marker scans on the Paper 8 source/support docs are clean; the tranche keeps
  Clay YM, Clay NS, dark-energy/LCDM, full SM reconstruction, full
  unification, and accepted-new-physics claims closed.

- 2026-05-29: Manager B integrated the Papers 5-7 / Moonshine bridge tranche
  using six reused workers.  Added the Closure-level
  `SupersingularPrimeLaneBridge` receipt, kept the richer Moonshine bridge as
  the Paper 1 citation surface, and imported the new Closure receipt into
  `DASHI.Everything`.  Paper 5 now states the finite prime-lane DHR theorem
  and conditional authority boundary in full draft form; Paper 6 now states
  the carrier Yukawa/alpha/Cabibbo target surface without physical CKM
  promotion; Paper 7 now states terminal composition as a typed obligation
  draft rather than a unification proof.  Paper 1 Markdown/TeX now removes
  first-principles-forcing language for the supersingular prime set and cites
  `SupersingularPrimeLaneBridge` with `primeSetForcedFromFirstPrinciples =
  false`.

- 2026-05-29: Manager reused the six existing worker lanes for the
  YM/NS Clay-frontier receipt tranche.  Added
  `CarrierRenormalizationGroupScaleReceipt` with the open
  dimensionful-mass-gap/RG-scale frontier and
  `CarrierNSSmoothConvergenceReceipt` with the open ultrametric
  Aubin-Lions/C-infinity convergence frontier.  Updated `DASHI.Everything`,
  `Docs/CrossPaperReceiptIndex.md`, `Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md`,
  `Docs/Paper8UnificationBlockerMap.md`, and
  `Docs/Paper8UnificationDraft.md` so the finite-depth positives and the two
  open Clay-level frontiers are separated explicitly.  Focused Agda checks for
  both new receipts, `git diff --check`, and the full `DASHI/Everything.agda`
  aggregate passed under the standard library/cubical include set.

- 2026-05-29: Manager B completed the pre-submission/frontier deployment using
  six reused worker lanes.  Paper 2 now keeps Friedmann instability paired
  with dark-energy/LCDM/cosmology non-promotion, Paper 3 foregrounds the
  depth-9 finite curvature readback, Paper 4 ties finite Stone staging to
  `physicalStoneCarrierPromotedIsFalse`, Paper 6 adds the honest `g12`
  DHR-sector parameter section, and Paper 7 lists full unification as typed
  obligations rather than a theorem.  Agda additions strengthen the RG and NS
  frontier receipts without promoting Clay flags, record the modular-j alpha
  numerical check as non-promoting, with alpha1 near-hit true at
  `72/|j(i)-j(rho)| = 72/1728 = 1/24`, `1.024%` discrepancy, unidentified
  correction `0.98976`, alpha2 no-hit, and `alphaDerivedFromModularGeometry = false`;
  and bind the current Monster-depth readback as a conjectural diagnostic.
  The final claim-governance scan is documented
  in `Docs/FinalClaimGovernanceScan.md`, Paper 8 metadata is in
  `Docs/Paper8ArxivSubmissionMetadata.md`, focused receipt checks pass, and
  the full `DASHI/Everything.agda` aggregate passes.
- 2026-05-29: Completed Manager C's immediate Hecke / DHR braiding / H0
  base-case tranche.  Implemented `Deg23HeckeEigenvalueReceipt` as a negative
  diagnostic: local eta-product expansion gives `a5=+1`, so the Hecke
  eigenvalue check does not close the p3-p5 residual.  Implemented
  `BraidingMorphismReceipt` as a finite bosonic symmetric-swap receipt, keeping
  nonabelian DHR/SM emergence false.  Implemented
  `H0OSPositivityBaseCase` as a selected finite PSD matrix receipt, keeping the
  full raw H0 OS base case and Clay YM false.  Wired all three into
  `DASHI.Everything` and refreshed Paper 8 receipt/checklist/blocker/index
  docs.

- 2026-05-30: Completed Manager C's gauge-group/closure tranche with six
  reused worker lanes.  Implemented the closure-level decoupling, Hecke-circle
  `U(1)_Y`, hypercharge table, anomaly verification, gravitational anomaly,
  SM gauge candidate, NS vorticity no-mechanism, VEV PDG-input,
  dimensionful-anchor, Phase 2 blocker, next-session priority, session grand
  summary, and final commit-protocol receipts.  Added complete Paper 6
  Section 1-3 and Paper 8 Section 5-6 draft sections, and updated the Paper 8
  receipt index.  The anomaly receipts use the left-handed Weyl convention
  with conjugated singlet hypercharges, so the cubic, mixed `SU(2)^2-U(1)_Y`,
  mixed `SU(3)^2-U(1)_Y`, and gravitational sums close at the standard table
  level while exact carrier-derived SM reconstruction remains false.  Focused
  Agda checks and the aggregate passed; promotion, marker, and diff scans are
  clean.

- 2026-05-30: Completed the Manager C Clay-reframe governance tranche in the
  tracked `Phase2ProgrammeReceipt` module after correcting an over-assignment
  outside Manager C scope.  The final retained surface is
  `ManagerCClayReframeReceipt`: YM is reframed through a conditional product
  lattice plus Balaban-authority route, NS is parked at the Leray ceiling,
  priorities are reordered toward Papers 6/8 first, and CP-from-CM-period
  remains the CKM external-input candidate.  Out-of-scope A/B worker receipt
  files are not retained in the final tree.
- 2026-06-02: Reused existing worker lanes for the sibling codec / 369 /
  continuous-support review after the worker pool hit the thread limit.  The
  `robust-context-fetch` DB pass resolved `Generator Codec Alignment`,
  `Optimal Triadic Decomposition RGB`, and `Branch · Topology and MDA/MDL`;
  the sibling repo pass verified concrete code surfaces in `dashitest`,
  `dashiCFD`, `dashifine`, and `dashiRTX`.  Added
  `SiblingCodecFiningContinuousSupportReceipt` to record the canonical
  support picture: quotient/symmetry first, balanced ternary residual planes,
  triadic action streams, block reuse, `E_seq` detail sheets, signed
  anisotropic atom fields, six fining layers, continuous lens topology, 369
  overlays, and ultrametric light-transport refresh demos.  The receipt is
  intentionally fail-closed: no production codec, Gate 3 density, continuum
  theorem, NS/YM theorem, or Clay claim is promoted.

- 2026-06-02: Continued the archive review with all six existing worker lanes.
  The remaining `robust-context-fetch` candidates separate cleanly into
  support and noise/provenance.  Incorporated the support threads into
  `SiblingCodecFiningContinuousSupportReceipt`: DNA cassette storage supplies
  the UV/Haar detail-sheet and 4-adic supervoxel analogy; the learner contexts
  supply tree-Haar/detail-band observables and codec-plane/video runtime
  diagnostics; `DASHI MAIN MATH DEC` supplies triadic-first codec design; the
  blocker/PUMUL thread supplies Base369/PNF/pressure/wave/RG routing; `Branch ·
  Math Mysticism Breakdown` supplies 369/supervoxel/anisotropy/twist grammar.
  Personal/no-title execution and hygiene traces are recorded as reviewed but
  not consumed as evidence.
