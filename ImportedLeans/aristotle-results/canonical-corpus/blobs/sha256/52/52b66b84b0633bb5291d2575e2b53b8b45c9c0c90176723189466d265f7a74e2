-- INHABITED LANDSCAPE
--
-- Urban, peri-urban and rural systems share a common situated carrier without
-- collapsing their differences.  Places may carry many simultaneous roles;
-- legal permission and observed use remain distinct; distance is indexed by
-- network/relation rather than assumed to be one universal metric.
