CodedFiniteStandardRawInterpreterFidelityExact pays typed-standard fidelity on every actual exact run: the self-delimited raw interpreter follows the genuine coded standard machine edge-for-edge with identical step count after the explicit Fin-to-Nat configuration projection. Full table-baked and raw syntactic self-code routes are theorem-level no-go results, so the surviving route is behavioural rather than literal code equality. The timing implementation is an explicit resource Pareto: phase-expanded exact handoff costs states=|Q|*(T+1), rules=T*|R|; the compact XOR/ripple counter has constant three-state/three-rule timer control, arbitrary-word exact standard-machine runs and one-decrement work <= bit-width+1, while reset/head-travel/global-budget costs remain explicit. IIT phi is not complexity hardness evidence. The principal live leaf is therefore literal compilation of the fixed interpreter/specializer recursion plus the final same-object resource fixed point." }
