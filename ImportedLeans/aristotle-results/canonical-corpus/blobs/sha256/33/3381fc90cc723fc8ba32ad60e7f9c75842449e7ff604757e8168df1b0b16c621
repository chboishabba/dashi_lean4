-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Formalize the pre-absorption endpoint requested for Com and kernel.  If a
-- physical owner reaches
--
--   P <= x y + A,
--   x^2 <= D,
--   y^2 <= C X,
--
-- then the repository's already-proved scaled Young inequality gives, for
-- EVERY positive rational epsilon,
--
--   P <= epsilon D + A + (epsilon^{-1}/4) C X.
--
-- Hence the owner is Young-soft and contributes no hard viscosity floor.
