# Kernel eigen-object and MDL clarifications

This note records three narrow clarifications for the DASHI kernel formalism. It does not strengthen the repository's current theorem claims.
## Biological eigenmode analogy
Kernel-saturated fixed points and low-action periodic orbits correspond to intrinsic eigenmodes of the constrained system, analogous to the recurrent Klüver form constants observed in human visual perception, which arise from neural geometry rather than learned symbolism.
This is an analogy and empirical interpretation boundary, not a theorem identifying DASHI kernel objects with cortical dynamics.
## Diagnostic residual versus monotone action
The inconsistency count `E(s)` is diagnostic only. The monotone used in any stabilisation claim is a separately specified action or description-length functional under an admissible projection rule:
```text
A (K s) <= A s
```
Such monotonicity must be proved or supplied by the selected kernel dynamics; it does not follow merely from sign-threshold updating. Consequently, `E(K s) <= E(s)` is not a default DASHI claim.
## Exact ternary support/sign factorisation
Balanced ternary admits an exact and invertible dependent factorisation into support and gated sign:
Trit  ~=  Sigma Support GatedSign
GatedSign inactive = Unit
GatedSign active   = Sign
The executable witness and both round-trip proofs are in `DASHI.Algebra.TritSupportSignFactor`. This establishes an exact carrier isomorphism. It does not by itself prove statistical minimality for every source model; entropy or sufficient-statistic claims require an explicit probability model.
This note records narrow clarifications for the DASHI kernel formalism and connects them to existing proved carrier and MDL surfaces. It does not strengthen the repository's physics or biological theorem claims.
Kernel-saturated fixed points and low-action periodic orbits correspond at the level of mathematical role to intrinsic modes of a constrained system, analogous to the recurrent Klüver form constants observed in human visual perception, which arise from neural geometry rather than learned symbolism.
This is an analogy and empirical interpretation boundary, not a theorem identifying DASHI kernel objects with cortical dynamics. The formal core records fixed points, finite periodic closure, and quotient-stable representatives without importing a cortical model.
`DASHI.Core.KernelEigenMDLBridge` reuses the existing `DASHI.MDL.MDLLyapunov` contract rather than defining a parallel action theory. Its `KernelActionSystem` packages a kernel, an existing `MDLFunctional`, and a proof-bearing `MDLLyapunov`; `kernelMDLMonotone` is therefore only a projection of the already supplied `decreases` field.
## Fixed, periodic, and quotient-stable objects
The formal bridge keeps three notions separate:
- `FixedPoint K s`: literal representative equality `K s ≡ s`;
- `PeriodicOrbit K s`: finite positive-period closure under iteration;
- `QuotientStable q K s`: one update preserves the quotient readout, `q (K s) ≡ q s`.
Every literal fixed point is quotient-stable under every quotient map, but quotient stability does not imply literal representative equality. This is the precise form of the earlier statement that a periodic or gauge-changing trajectory may stabilise as one class in `Q`.
The same module now proves the involution compatibility that links the algebraic and codec readings:
support (inv t) = support t
encode (inv t)  = supportSignInv (encode t)
Thus ternary involution preserves the activity mask and reverses only the gated sign. This is the concrete cross-pollination seam between `DASHI.Algebra.Trit`, mask/sign residual coding, and involution-equivariant kernel designs; binary bitplanes remain implementation carriers rather than new semantic primitives.
## Claim boundary
These additions prove finite carrier and equality facts only. They do not establish cortical equivalence, convergence of arbitrary threshold kernels, monotonicity of `E`, Shannon optimality, or a physical interpretation of every kernel eigen-object.
