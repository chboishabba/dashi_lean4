-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Make the owner-reserve architecture gate executable at the theorem level.
-- The primal and dual lanes previously used different carriers: the physical
-- family stores nine AdmissibleOwnerEstimate values, while the Farkas theorem
-- uses a NineVector.  This file proves the exact carrier identification and
-- then proves that an applicable dual no-go certificate and a strict physical
-- owner budget cannot coexist.
--
-- Thus the prescribed decision is now literal:
--
--   primal strict budget  => continue;
--   exact dual certificate applicable to the same eta vector => redesign.
--
-- A numerical optimizer is neither trusted nor required by this theorem.
