-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Correct the scalar mismatch in the old Round-26/30 ODE bridge.  The syntax
-- of a Galerkin coordinate equation has rational coefficients, but the state
-- variables of the physical ODE must live in a complete real carrier.  Using
-- Q itself as the trajectory carrier would therefore be wrong.
--
-- This module keeps the existing exact rational atom syntax and gives it a
-- literal semantics in the repository's pinned Murray--Bishop constructive
-- reals.  Rational coefficients are embedded by Bishop's constant-sequence
-- embedding, while state variables are genuine Bishop reals.
--
-- The key algebraic theorem is proved again on that real carrier:
--
--   c x y - c u v
--     = c ((x-u)y + u(y-v)),
--
-- together with the linear case and arbitrary finite sums.  Equality is
-- Bishop's extensional setoid equality, not Agda propositional equality.
-- Thus the degree-two finite Galerkin Lipschitz algebra is no longer tied to
-- an incomplete rational state space.
--
-- This is a real semantic producer, not yet Picard--Lindelof: local existence
-- still requires a finite-dimensional norm/contraction theorem on this
-- Bishop-real assignment carrier.
