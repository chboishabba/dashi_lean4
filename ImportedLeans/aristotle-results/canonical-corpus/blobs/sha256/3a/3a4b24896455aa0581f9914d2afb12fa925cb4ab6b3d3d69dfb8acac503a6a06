-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- CMP109's differentiated tree factors are operator/multilinear compositions,
-- so the source-faithful telescope is NONCOMMUTATIVE.  For finite products
--
--   A_1 ... A_n  and  B_1 ... B_n,
--
-- the recursive identity
--
--   A P - B Q = (A-B) P + B (P-Q)
--
-- gives the ordered replacement expansion
--
--   A_1...A_n - B_1...B_n
--     = (A_1-B_1)A_2...A_n
--       + B_1(A_2-B_2)A_3...A_n
--       + ...
--       + B_1...B_{n-1}(A_n-B_n).
--
-- With ||A_i||,||B_i|| <= b_i and ||A_i-B_i|| <= m_i, triangle inequality
-- and norm submultiplicativity yield the same ordered scalar majorant.  Thus
-- the physical Lemma 7 producer supplies only factorwise ordinary/marked
-- operator bounds; no whole tree-product replacement estimate remains.
