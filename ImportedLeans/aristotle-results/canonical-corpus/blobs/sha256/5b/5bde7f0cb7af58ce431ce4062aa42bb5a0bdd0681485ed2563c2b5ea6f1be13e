# Architecture Notes for DashI Closure Path

## Reader Navigation

Use the repo through one canonical map and two reader tracks:

- entry surface: `README.md`
- repo structure guide: `Docs/RepoGuide.md`
- physics/unification guide: `Docs/PhysicsGuide.md`
- compressed claim surface: `Docs/UnificationClaim.md`
- origin traceability ledger: `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md`
- core-spine bridge: `Docs/CoreSpineBridge.md`
- ITIR/PNF residual bridge: `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`
- boundary/example lane: `Docs/AntifascisticBoundaryAndMusic.md`
- music attractor target: `Docs/MusicalAttractorTheorem.md`
- strong theorem owners:
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`
- atom/wave secondary note: `Docs/AtomAndWaveRecoveryStatus.md`
- recovery truth surfaces: `Docs/PhysicsRecoveryLedger.md`, `Docs/ArchiveRecoveryCrosswalk.md`

Classification discipline for those surfaces:

- `proved`: current canonical theorem route and what it strictly establishes
- `bridge`: interpretation layers that connect formal and physics-facing statements
- `packaging`: assembly layers that bundle existing lanes without upgrading claims
- `empirical`: measurement/data lanes with explicit non-claim boundaries
- `speculative`: roadmap or intuition surfaces outside the current theorem contract

## Diagram Entry Points

The canonical textual diagram surfaces for this repo are:

- `Docs/RepoMetasystem.puml`
- `Docs/RepoMetasystem.svg`
- `Docs/diagrams/TaoQiPolarityMetasystem.puml`
- `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.puml`
- `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.svg`
- `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`
- `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.svg`
- `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`
- `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.svg`
- `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.puml`
- `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.svg`
- `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml`
- `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`

Regenerate rendered SVG and PNG previews with:

```bash
./scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh
```

Use them in this order:

1. `Docs/RepoMetasystem.*` for repo-level orientation
2. `Docs/diagrams/TaoQiPolarityMetasystem.puml` for the Tao -> symbol geometry -> yin/yang -> Qi -> phase/field interpretive stack
3. `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.*` for the canonical theorem route
4. `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` for origin/disconnection governance
5. `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.*` for claim boundaries and open gaps
6. `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.*` for "how this touches actual physics"
7. child graphs such as observable/signature and training-dynamics only after the first six

Diagram-reading rule:
the status boards in `RepoMetasystem`, `CanonicalProofSpine`,
`PhysicsUnificationMap`, and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap` are intentional. Green is
theorem-owned, yellow is bridge/advanced-but-blocked, blue is packaging,
red/pink is empirical or open-gate material. Do not recolor a box without a
named theorem owner or an explicit ledger update.

## Canonical Spine (Authoritative)
The canonical closure dependency spine is:

1. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefect`
2. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`
3. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefectToParallelogram`
4. `DASHI.Geometry.QuadraticForm`
5. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`
6. `DASHI.Geometry.CausalForcesLorentz31`
7. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`
8. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
9. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`

This is the only required theorem route for quadratic and signature emergence.

## Strong Claim Owners

The strong repo-native physics-unification claim now lives in code first:

1. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`
2. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`
3. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`

Read them in that order.

- `UnifiedPhysicsTheorem` is the main owner for the strong claim.
- `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` is the atom/chemistry interpretation carrier.
- `PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter` is the explicit seam between
  abstract `UnifiedClosure.PhysicsUnification` and the canonical
  checklist/package/full-closure story.

## Route Classification Policy
- `canonical`: required for Stage C theorem closure claims.
- `alternative`: mathematically valid alternate derivation; not required.
- `validation`: independent cross-check used to reduce proof-risk.
- `experimental`: speculative or partial scaffolding not used for closure claims.

Modules currently in the quadratic family
(`QuadraticFromNorm`, `QuadraticFromProjection`, `QuadraticFromParallelogram`,
`QuadraticEmergence`, `QuadraticFormEmergence`) should be classified under this
policy and consumed accordingly.

## Remaining Architecture Work
1. Keep `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram` and
   `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` as the active canonical bottleneck bridge
   surfaces.
2. Replace any raw seam placeholders with named seam packages on canonical
   modules only.
3. Thread signature/Clifford/gauge recovery from canonical spine exports
   instead of parallel emergence routes.
4. Keep signature and Clifford routes logically separate:
   - signature route:
     `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`
   - Clifford route:
     `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
     (canonical bilinear from normalized quadratic, then Clifford presentation).

## WaveLift⇒Even Architecture Rule (2026-03-11)
1. `Quadratic⇒Clifford` is the sole upstream producer for
   `WaveLift⇒Even` on the canonical path.
2. `WaveLift⇒Even` is a factorization theorem, not a predicate-only claim:
   `State → Cl` must factor through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`.
3. Add explicit Clifford grading interface (`parity`, closure on multiplication,
   unit-even witness) at the canonical Clifford bridge layer.
4. Define canonical wave lift using even Clifford words so image-evenness is by
   construction.
5. Keep this independent from full Dirac operator semantics at this stage.

Current status: implemented and validated with targeted checks on
`CliffordEvenLiftBridge`, `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
`CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`, and
`KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`.

## Tao/YinYang/Qi Interpretive Stack

The current cultural/interpretive stack is now explicitly layered as:

1. `DASHI.Culture.TaoChapterReadingReceipt`
2. `DASHI.Culture.TaoOperatorGrammar`
3. `DASHI.Culture.YinYangSymbolGeometryBoundary`
4. `DASHI.Culture.YinYangPolarityBoundary`
5. `DASHI.Interop.TaoYinYangAdapter`
6. `DASHI.Interop.YinYangQiAdapter`
7. `DASHI.Interop.PolarityPhaseFieldBridge`
8. `DASHI.Interop.PolarityBettiSupportBoundary`
9. `DASHI.Interop.BettiQiAdapter`
10. `DASHI.Interop.CarryCompletionSpectralBridge`
11. `DASHI.Interop.TaoQiReadingAdapter`
12. `DASHI.Interop.TaoMeditationQiAdapter`
13. `DASHI.Promotion.PolarityFieldObligationIndex`
14. `DASHI.Promotion.TaoQiObligationIndex`

Architecture rule for this stack:

- Tao supplies source-dependent motifs and chapter-local candidate readings.
- Yin-yang symbol geometry supplies the formulaic circle, eye, teardrop, region, and S-curve support surface for the polarity boundary.
- Yin/yang supplies the polarity and transition grammar between Tao operators and Qi formal-lens/operator surfaces.
- The carry/completion bridge preserves exact 3-adic, moonshine, quotient-seam, and Stage12 carry-depth receipts before any candidate-only cultural rereading is attached.
- The polarity-phase-field bridge is where local `TriTruth`/`HexTruth`/`NonaryTruth`, voxel/supervoxel support, and wave/superposition grammar sit.
- Betti support sits over that local support geometry as a candidate-only topology summary layer for connected components, loops, and voids before Qi interpretation.
- Qi remains the carrier/role/formal-lens substrate.
- Every layer is candidate-only and fail-closed on doctrine, empirical, clinical, spiritual, mystical, metaphysical, political, philological, theorem, runtime, and reciprocal validation authority.

## Stage12 And Prime-Lane Hierarchy

The stage/carry route is now ordered as:

1. `DASHI.Algebra.StageQuotient`
2. `DASHI.Algebra.StageQuotientIrreversibilityBoundary`
3. `DASHI.Interop.CarryCompletionSpectralBridge`
4. `DASHI.Interop.PrimeSuccessorWitness`
5. `DASHI.Interop.PrimeLaneStage12ActionAdapter`
6. prime-local witnesses such as `DASHI.Physics.Closure.P7Stage7C6HexRegression`

Architecture rule for this tranche:

- `Stage12FibreSurface` is the global stage/carry/fibre atlas.
- `Stage12FibreSurface is the spine` for this tranche.
- `PrimeSuccessorWitness` records the cleaner successor law: `p` is the new prime lane, `p - 1` is the witness-space that proves what `p` can act on, and `+1` is the move from witness-space into the new prime lane.
- The canonical successor rows are `p2 -> 1`, `p3 -> 2`, `p5 -> 4`, `p7 -> 6`, `p11 -> 10`, and `p13 -> 12`.
- The wider `0..11` stage window is classified by successor-witness kind, not only by prime cases. The immediate witness of stage `n` is `n + 1`.
- prime successor witnesses open a new irreducible lane: `1 -> 2`, `2 -> 3`, `4 -> 5`, `6 -> 7`, `10 -> 11`, and `12 -> 13`.
- prime-power depth witnesses deepen one existing axis: `3 -> 4 = 2^2`, `7 -> 8 = 2^3`, and `8 -> 9 = 3^2`.
- composite coupling witnesses couple previously opened axes: `5 -> 6 = 2 * 3`, `9 -> 10 = 2 * 5`, and `11 -> 12 = 2^2 * 3`.
- The witness-body rule is therefore: successor prime means new prime-axis witness, successor prime power means p-adic depth witness, and successor composite with multiple primes means coupled-axis witness.
- Prime-local unit-group lanes plug into that atlas through typed local adapters; they do not replace it.
- The p7 tranche is the first clean prime-local exemplar because `(Z/7Z)^x` has order `6`, aligning naturally with the `HexTruth` lane.
- `p13` is the natural full Stage12 witness because `13 - 1 = 12`; inside the `0..11` atlas it is recorded as the successor witness over the whole Stage12 carrier rather than as a replacement for that carrier.
- `P7Stage7C6HexRegression` is therefore a local regression witness over the Stage12 surface, not the definition of Stage12 itself.
- Future prime lanes should consume the same Stage12 quotient/carry-depth seam rather than inventing parallel stage semantics.
- The same successor law is now widened to a typed `0..111` window receipt: for every stage `n`, the witness is still `n + 1`, but the larger field is classified by factorization and carry layer rather than only by the `0..11` microcycle.
- `0..111` is split into three decimal carry layers: `0..9`, `10..99`, and `100..111`.
- `111 = 100 + 10 + 1 = j2 + j1 + j0` is the first tri-marked decimal/carry state in that widened window.
- `111 -> 112 = 2^4 * 7`, so the final witness of the window couples fourth-depth binary carry recursion to the `p7` / `HexTruth` lane.
- The inclusive window size is itself `112 = 2^4 * 7`, which means `0..111` forms a `112`-stage witness field rather than just a longer tabulation.
- `0..111` contains nine full Stage12 blocks plus a four-stage overflow: 108..111.
- The main carry/composite seam highlights in that widened field are `99 -> 100 = 2^2 * 5^2`, `109 -> 110 = 2 * 5 * 11`, `110 -> 111 = 3 * 37`, and `111 -> 112 = 2^4 * 7`.
- The glyph string `111` is typed by base: `111_10 = 3 * 37`, while `111_3 = 13`.
- `111_3 = 13` is the `p13` witness of Stage12 because `13 - 1 = 12`.
- `111_3` is also the length-3 finite prefix of the all-ones 3-adic expansion `111..._3 = -1/2` in `Q3`, so finite-prefix and completion-boundary readings stay distinct but linked.

## Performance Intent
Reducing parallel dependency paths lowers normalization and transport overhead.
Expected effect: lower compile pressure without changing theorem content.
