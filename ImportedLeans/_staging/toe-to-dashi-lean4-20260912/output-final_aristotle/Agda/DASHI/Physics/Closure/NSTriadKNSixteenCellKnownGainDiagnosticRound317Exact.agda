------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ROUND317 / SYMBOLIC SIXTEEN-CELL KNOWN-GAIN DIAGNOSTIC
--
-- R315 fixes the exact missing squared dyadic gain after heat for each oriented
-- outer critical region.  R316 refines the inner route enough to distinguish
-- the only two currently-owned candidate gain mechanisms:
--
--   homochiral radial-near:
--     a certified amplitude gain delta_radial, hence squared gain 2 delta;
--
--   heterochiral HH->low:
--     R312 relocates one derivative from inner high shell m to inner output p,
--     hence squared gain 2 (m-j_p).
--
-- The other two inner routes receive ZERO automatic gain from the currently
-- owned inner commutator geometry.  This is not a no-go theorem for those
-- routes; it is a least-privilege statement about what has actually been
-- proved so far.
