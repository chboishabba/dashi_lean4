-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Replace the equality-only four-owner budget interface by a robust
-- less-than-or-equal interface with explicit slack
--
--   Delta_YM = 55/18874368 - (c_loc+c_tr+c_near+c_far).
--
-- The slack is allocated to the far owner only when converting to the legacy
-- equality reducer.  Since the physical charge and the slack are nonnegative,
-- the enlarged far coefficient remains a valid upper bound.  This lets exact
-- or interval-generated estimates expose unused margin instead of silently
-- spending the whole singleton allowance.
