-- Fail-closed provenance quarantine.
--
-- These entries are NOT literature authorities and are NOT imported by any
-- theorem producer.  They record public completion claims encountered during
-- the provenance audit so that a future contributor cannot accidentally cite a
-- claimed Millennium solution as an established premise.
--
-- Quarantine is not a mathematical refutation.  It means only that the item is
-- self-published/unrefereed, makes a completion-level claim, and has not been
-- independently reduced to the repository's exact theorem interfaces.
