## Source-bounded reading

The paper is retained as a successful MVP / feasibility study. It demonstrates that manually labelled student feedback can train an NLP/deep-learning prototype to classify later feedback using the Online Engagement Framework and visualise aggregate signals at faculty, school, programme, and course levels.

The source reports:

- 383 manually labelled training feedback sentiments;
- 311 later testing feedback sentiments;
- 76% overall reported accuracy;
- category-specific precision, F1, recall, and balanced accuracy;
- uneven training counts and performance across the five engagement elements;
- open issues around label balance, annotation bias, ambiguity, sarcasm, domain-specific language, data quality, and single-institution scope.

The formalisation does not replace the paper’s claim with a stronger one. It preserves the MVP contribution while making its promotion boundaries explicit.

## Five OEF engagement fibres

The five elements are represented as overlapping fibres rather than mutually exclusive student essences:

1. **Social engagement** — community, belonging, relationships, and trust.
2. **Cognitive engagement** — critical thought, metacognition, integration, justification, deep disciplinary understanding, and distributed expertise.
3. **Behavioural engagement** — academic skills, opportunities and challenges, multidisciplinary skills, agency, online norms, and peer support.
4. **Collaborative engagement** — learning with peers, faculty relationships, institutional opportunities, and professional networks.
5. **Emotional engagement** — expectations, assumptions, motivation, and commitment to learning.

A comment about learning through online forum discussion may inhabit cognitive, behavioural, collaborative, and social fibres simultaneously. Overlap is therefore retained as signal rather than treated as classification failure.

## Formal pipeline

```text
student ecology / feedback hypervoxel
  → voluntary end-of-course textual projection
  → human OEF interpretation and labels
  → cleaned labelled training surface
  → model-predicted OEF bundle and sentiment proxy
  → aggregate visualisation
  → contextual human review
  → residual hypothesis
  → small, reversible, agency-safe pedagogical +1 candidate
  → evidence return
```

The machine scales a human coding frame. It does not remove interpretation or directly observe engagement truth. The `HumanCodingMachineCompilationBridge` records the common architecture shared by manual qualitative coding and supervised classification:

```text
text + coding frame + interpreter → categorised-meaning candidate
```

Repeatability is useful, but it does not make the coding frame neutral or turn the predicted category into latent student meaning.

## Main residual vector

The implementation distinguishes:

- sampling residual;
- non-response residual;
- annotation residual;
- classification residual;
- semantic residual;
- multi-label compression residual;
- ecological residual;
- intersectional residual;
- temporal residual;
- pedagogical residual.

These residuals interact and are not collapsed into the single reported accuracy number.

## Hard boundaries

```text
AI classification ≠ student meaning
survey response ≠ complete student voice
respondents ≠ full cohort
no response ≠ neutral / satisfied / disengaged
missing classification ≠ missing engagement
sentiment proxy ≠ wellbeing truth
aggregate chart ≠ individual student
high aggregate engagement ≠ equitable engagement
end-point feedback ≠ longitudinal trajectory
later-semester transfer ≠ causal redesign effect
OEF categories ≠ whole student ecology
dashboard output ≠ pedagogical authority
candidate +1 ≠ automatic intervention
```

## Intersectional and privacy lift

Axis-aware analysis is permitted only under:

- opt-in consent;
- privacy protection;
- minimum-cell governance;
- no reidentification;
- no deficit promotion;
- local contextual review.

Group differences remain aggregate candidate surfaces and cannot be projected into individual diagnosis or deficit ontology.

## Longitudinal lift

The paper’s training-semester to later-testing-semester structure is retained as a weak transfer surface. The formalisation does not invent matched longitudinal OEF vectors where the paper does not report them. Stronger trajectory or intervention claims require repeated measurements, comparable cohorts, implementation receipts, student interpretation, confound audit, and replication.

## Pedagogical +1 routing

AI output may route attention toward possible support handles, including clearer navigation, explicit expectations, peer connection, teacher presence, reduced overload, or chosen human check-ins. A handle becomes an admissible `+1` only after student choice, contextual fit, low burden, non-shaming, non-surveillance, human review, opt-out, and measurable evidence-return gates pass.
