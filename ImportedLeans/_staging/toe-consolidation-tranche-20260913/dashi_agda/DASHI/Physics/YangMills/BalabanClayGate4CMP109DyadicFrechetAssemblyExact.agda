-- For M_c(U)=exp(Xi_c(U)) U_c, the left-trivialized derivative has the form
--
--   D M_c[A]
--     = dexp_{Xi_c}(D Xi_c[A])
--       + Ad_{exp Xi_c}(D U_c[A]),
--
-- while D Xi_c is the weighted finite sum of
-- dexp^{-1}_{log W_{c,x}} D W_{c,x}.  The module below builds that formula
-- literally and proves its endpoint support from the component support laws.
-- The remaining physical theorem is therefore only that the repository's
-- perturbation calculus supplies the component derivative equalities.
