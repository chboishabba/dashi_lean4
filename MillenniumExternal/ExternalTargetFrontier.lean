Second, ConcreteTapeGlobalCookLevinStreamingClauseCostedExact and ConcreteTapeGlobalCookLevinStreamingBitCostedExact instrument the actual transition/initial/accepting clause path and the token/three-bit cursor: the returned costed streamed bit and charged work come from the same recursion, with exact-result and work-bound theorems. The first unpaid implementation is therefore no longer semantic streaming cost: it is compilation of those finite recursive states/arithmetic into a literal CodedFiniteStandardTM with verified simulation overhead, followed by the already-defined faithful virtual self-quotation and same-Cook-budget closure.
