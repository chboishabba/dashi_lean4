-- The total connected-activity amplitude is not an unnamed g.  It is the sum
-- of determinant, interaction, chart, gauge and localization amplitudes.  Each
-- channel spends a named allowance, and distributivity proves that the total
-- coupling-times-volume estimate spends exactly the sum of those allowances.
