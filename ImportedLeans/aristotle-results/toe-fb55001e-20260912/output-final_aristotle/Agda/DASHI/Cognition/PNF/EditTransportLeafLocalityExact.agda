-- Edit transport and provenance-bearing occurrence identity.
--
-- Runtime motivation: a source edit may move an otherwise unchanged semantic
-- occurrence. Correspondence must therefore transport source coordinates; it
-- must not identify leaves by the semantic value whose change we are trying to
-- measure.
--
-- `supportCoordinates` stands for the ordered source-support occurrence list.
-- `structuralPositionKey` and `provenancePathKey` stand for already-numeric,
-- proof-bearing structural coordinates (role/slot/interface path, etc.).

-- Reverse-dependency closure locality.

-- Soundness and precision are intentionally different propositions:
--
--   sound: every actually changed leaf lies inside the predicted closure;
--   exact: every predicted leaf actually changes.
--
-- The runtime may safely over-approximate while still being inefficient. A
-- verified soundness claim therefore must not be silently promoted to exactness.

-- Full audit certificate.

-- A verified small-edit result needs BOTH:
--   1. unique transported occurrence correspondence for every eligible leaf;
--   2. changed-leaf inclusion in the reverse-dependency closure.
--
-- Semantic value equality is deliberately absent from the correspondence
-- premise, so the audit does not assume the conclusion it is trying to test.
