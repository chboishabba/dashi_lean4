------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lightweight A/B/C composition surface.

-- Round60 makes A fail closed at one object: a physical source plus estimates
-- indexed by that source.  The transfer is a derived view, not an independently
-- supplied witness with a later same-object equality.  B now imports only the
-- lightweight canonical normalized-fibre source, avoiding the legacy envelope
-- graph in focused leaf checks.
