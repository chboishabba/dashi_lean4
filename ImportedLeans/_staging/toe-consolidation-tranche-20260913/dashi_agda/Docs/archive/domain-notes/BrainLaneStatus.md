# Brain Lane Status

Declared surface level: `adjacent lane with theorem-thin local owner surfaces`,
not a local closure or brain theorem lane.

This note is the compact status surface for the brain-side lane shown on the
physics diagrams. Its purpose is to keep the roadmap truthful without
overstating what is localized in this repo.

## Current Sources Of Truth

- `Docs/PhysicsGuide.md`
- `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`
- `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`
- sibling-repo adjacent work in `../dashiBRAIN`
- archive / NotebookLM context used to justify the lane as part of the wider
  DASHI program

## Current Status

The brain-side lane is real in program scope. It is still adjacent in the
program-level sense, but it is no longer "archive only" inside
`dashi_agda`.

What is local here:

- roadmap and unification diagrams that show the lane explicitly
- claim-boundary language that marks the lane as adjacent rather than proved
- theorem-thin local owner surface in `Ontology/Brain/BrainVocabularySurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local coarse-summary surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainCoarseSummarySurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local extraction/coarse-graining surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainExtractionSurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local invariant surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainInvariantSurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local invariant-depth surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainInvariantDepth.agda`
- theorem-thin local region-automaton owner surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainRegionAutomatonSurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local visual form-constant / log-polar owner surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainVisualFormConstantSurface.agda`
- non-promoting connectome/fMRI observation quotient target in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BrainConnectomeFMRIObservationQuotient.agda`
- theorem-thin local learning/eigenbasis phase-profile owner surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainLearningEigenbasisSurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local morphospace/gap-junction owner surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainMorphospaceGapJunctionSurface.agda`
- theorem-thin local downstream theme-consumer law surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainThemeConsumerLaws.agda`
- non-promoting external numeric Drosophila / hemibrain receipt surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/DrosophilaHemibrainExternalRunReceipt.agda`
- non-promoting single-scale closure receipt in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainKernelClosureReceipt.agda`
- non-promoting single-scale gauge-robustness receipt in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainGaugeRobustnessReceipt.agda`
- non-promoting coarse-grain persistence obstruction in
  `Ontology/Brain/DrosophilaCoarseGrainPersistenceObstruction.agda`
- non-promoting governance proviso surface in
  `Ontology/Brain/BrainGovernanceProviso.agda`
- checksum manifest for the selected sibling-repo artifacts in
  `Docs/DrosophilaHemibrainArtifactManifest.md`
- the local extraction/invariant/invariant-depth stack is now explicitly
  consumed from `Ontology/BrainDNA/`, not only declared in isolation
- nearby crossover interfaces on the DNA / channel side that may later become
  stronger bridge points

What is adjacent rather than local:

- most brain-specific structure, datasets, and analysis code
- current hemibrain / Drosophila-oriented analysis code in `../dashiBRAIN`,
  except for the selected external numeric receipts and checksums now mirrored
  as non-promoting Brain lane evidence
- archive-backed design language relating brain structure to wider DASHI
  modeling

## Drosophila / Hemibrain Receipt Status

Selected sibling-repo artifacts from `../dashiBRAIN` are now recorded locally
as receipts, not as theorem promotion.

Positive bounded receipt:

- `outputs/defect_curve_20260120-142843.csv` records the baseline single-scale
  defect trace `633, 42, 2, 0`
- `outputs/sprint3_default_geometry_summary.json` records the selected
  geometry summary: `179907` nodes, `7084254` edges, final state
  `{+1: 137901, 0: 42006, -1: 0}`, and `8` +1 components
- `Ontology/Brain/BrainKernelClosureReceipt.agda` packages only this
  single-scale external numeric closure receipt
- `Ontology/Brain/BrainGaugeRobustnessReceipt.agda` records Sprint 3
  single-scale gauge robustness from the source docs

Negative receipt:

- selected coarse-grain curves for random blocks, degree-binned blocks, ROI,
  radius `r=1`, and radius `r=2` are all one-step `0` curves
- `Ontology/Brain/DrosophilaCoarseGrainPersistenceObstruction.agda` records
  this as a multiscale persistence obstruction

The checksum source is `Docs/DrosophilaHemibrainArtifactManifest.md`.

Claim boundary:

- safe to say: selected external numeric evidence supports single-scale
  hemibrain kernel closure and tested single-scale gauge robustness
- safe to say: selected coarse-grain receipts obstruct multiscale persistence
  promotion
- unsafe to say: full Drosophila brain recovery, biological component
  interpretation, local Brain theorem closure, or physics/empirical promotion

## High-Resolution fMRI Observation Quotient

`DASHI/Physics/Closure/BrainConnectomeFMRIObservationQuotient.agda` records the
current perception-facing empirical target:

`phase orbit class -> neural state initialization -> connectome-constrained
processing -> high-resolution/laminar fMRI readout -> behavioral report`.

This is not a validation receipt. It only states the observation quotient that
would make the Kluver/form-constant lane testable. The missing receipts are a
connectome dataset, neural-transition calibration, laminar/high-resolution fMRI
protocol, phase-orbit stimulus protocol, behavioral report binding, frozen
readout distance/separation threshold, and an empirical comparison run.

The formal target now includes `X_brain = (V,E,W,sigma)`, a connectome carrier
`C = (V,E,W,Lambda)`, a ternary neuronal state carrier, a
connectome-constrained threshold transition, MDL processing energy
`delta_C`, a connectome symmetry quotient, a processing orbit quotient, an
inverse-observation problem, and the key laminar constraint that fMRI readout
must factor through layer profile rather than collapse directly to a coarse
regional scalar.

The latest target also names the proof obligations that would turn this into a
real bridge: pointwise gate law for the ternary threshold update, accepted
complexity order for `delta_C`, descent soundness, quotient equivalence laws,
class-of-state projection, and symmetry-respecting readout/bridge laws.

Safe to say: high-resolution fMRI is a candidate macroscopic observation
channel for testing phase-orbit classes through connectome-constrained neural
processing.

Unsafe to say: fMRI validates Kluver classes, connectome structure determines
processing, or the Brain lane proves perception/cognition/consciousness
closure.

### Archive Context: Bidirectional Observation Surface

Resolved local Perplexity thread:

- title: `As you can see in the pumls there are many blockers`
- online thread id: `8daefbbb-e5e4-4c27-92c2-9cf7e9de0aa3`
- canonical thread id: `9fd02df16462bcb491ed4c155b1a4e73ba0fb173`
- source: local DB `~/chat_archive.sqlite`; web not used

The archive sharpens the intended brain/perception formalism beyond the current
non-promoting quotient target. The key additional structure is a bidirectional
observation architecture over the same latent neuronal orbit:

`sigma_t -> pi_fMRI(sigma_{t:t+Delta}) -> B_t`

and separately:

`sigma_t -> pi_percept(sigma_t) -> report/percept class`.

The important claim boundary is that fMRI is not ground truth and not the
percept. It is a delayed, spatially pooled, vascular/metabolic quotient. The
archive proposes using complementary kernels:

`ker pi_fMRI` and `ker pi_percept`

as the reason joint inference can constrain the latent neuronal state better
than either fMRI or subjective report alone. The earlier local fMRI module has
observation, inverse, and laminar-readout handles; the dedicated
bidirectional-observation theorem surface is now separated into its own
non-promoting module.

The same archive also extends the target from brain-only observation to a
whole-body coupled resource system: increased blood or energy demand in one
brain region must be balanced against cardiovascular pumping, losses, and
system-wide energetic constraints. That whole-body coupling is now named as a
resource-gating surface, not solved as a physiological model.

Safe archive-aligned wording: the Brain lane should eventually model fMRI,
perceptual report, and whole-body resource observables as complementary
quotients of coupled latent dynamics.

This is now localized as a theorem-thin, non-promoting surface in
`DASHI/Physics/Closure/BidirectionalBrainObservationQuotient.agda`, with focused
documentation in `Docs/BidirectionalBrainObservationQuotient.md`. The module
names `sigma_t`, lossy many-to-one quotients `pi_fMRI`, `pi_percept`,
`pi_behavior`, and `pi_bodyResource`, joint narrowing of observational
equivalence classes, and whole-body resource constraints over blood, oxygen,
glucose, thermal load, and cardiovascular work.

The localized boundary remains explicitly non-promoting: fMRI is not percept,
report is not ground truth, joint narrowing is not latent-state recovery, and
there is no qualia, cognition, consciousness, or empirical brain closure.

Unsafe wording: fMRI equals percept, subjective report equals ground truth,
brain dynamics can be isolated from body energy/circulation when making a
quantitative physiological claim, or current local Agda has already proved the
bidirectional/whole-body bridge.

## Developmental Genomic Inverse Bridge

`DASHI/Physics/Closure/DevelopmentalGenomicInverseBridge.agda` records the
brain/development extension:

`g -> R_t -> M_t -> N_t -> C_t -> T_C -> sigma_t -> O(sigma_t)`.

This treats DNA as a generator of developmental constraints. It does not treat
DNA as a rigid brain blueprint or as an encoding of thoughts, percepts, or a
final connectome snapshot. The forward chain stages genome, regulatory
activation, morphogenesis, neural differentiation, connectome formation, mature
processing, neuronal state, and observable readout as typed layers.

The inverse side is:

`DeltaY -> DeltaO -> DeltaT_C -> DeltaC -> DeltaM -> DeltaR -> candidate Delta g`.

This makes observed phenotype or brain-condition differences inverse probes
over a candidate regulatory fibre. Candidate perturbations are ranked by
phenotype residual, MDL perturbation cost, pleiotropy penalty, and
layer-constraint penalty.

Safe to say: known structural or functional phenotype differences can be
staged as typed developmental residuals that shrink a candidate
regulatory/genomic search space.

Safe fixture wording: selected biomedical or developmental examples may be
listed only as calibration fixtures for testing whether the inverse ranking
surface preserves known ground truth, residual layering, fibre refinement, and
laminar narrowing.

Synthetic fixture wording: GFP/RFP reporter, metabolic odor, and short-vs-long
pathway examples may be listed only as engineered construct calibration tests
for `SyntheticBiologyInverse`, pending construct-library, forward-model,
phenotype, burden, compatibility, ranking, and natural/synthetic score-bridge
receipts.

Unsafe to say: the bridge validates disease genes, proves gene causation,
establishes a pathway mechanism, narrows a real patient condition, recovers
biology, validates wet-lab constructs, designs CRISPR edits, optimizes host
systems, transfers synthetic validation to natural biology, or closes
cognition/perception.

## Conditional Exclusion / Proviso

The Brain lane is excluded from physics promotion. Its current role is
non-promoting governance support and theorem-thin adjacent packaging only.

The active W1-W6 physics lanes remain assigned to their direct typed kill
conditions in `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BlockerKillConditions.agda`. Brain-side
receipts do not replace those kill conditions, do not construct their authority
tokens, and do not promote any W1-W6 physics lane by lateral prose.

The only permitted conditional role is lateral support review. Brain may become
eligible for that review only if a direct physics lane enters typed exhaustion
and no typed retarget remains available for that direct lane. Even then, the
Brain lane supplies review pressure or candidate support targets only; it still
does not claim physics promotion, biological recovery, multiscale persistence,
or unification.

Local Agda surface:

- `Ontology/Brain/BrainGovernanceProviso.agda` records the non-promoting Brain
  role, imports the W1-W6 kill-condition rows, sets Brain and physics
  promotion flags to `false`, and marks the default lateral-review status as
  not eligible.

## Notebook-Confirmed Brain Themes

The NotebookLM-backed archive context confirms that the broader DASHI program
contains explicit discussion of these brain-side themes.

## Localization Matrix

| Theme | Present in notebook | Present in sibling repo | Localized in Agda here | Not yet localized |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brain-region automaton mapping | yes | not directly evidenced by quick local scan | yes | no |
| Klüver form constants / log-polar V1/V2 geometry | yes | not directly evidenced by quick local scan | yes | no |
| Grokking / eigenbasis / Fourier-basis phase transition | yes | not directly evidenced by quick local scan | yes | no |
| Gap junctions / morphospace error correction | yes | not directly evidenced by quick local scan | yes | no |

Notes:

- `present in notebook` is backed by the current NotebookLM notebook and source
  titles already checked in this repo workflow.
- `present in sibling repo` is conservative here: a quick thematic scan of
  `../dashiBRAIN` did not directly surface these exact themes by name.
- `localized in Agda here` is currently `no` for all four because no dedicated
  theorem owner modules existed at the time the matrix was introduced. It is
  now `yes` for the three themes listed above that have landed local owner
  modules.

    tissue-level recovery dynamics

## Current Implementation Lanes

The current bounded implementation ownership for the brain-side lane is:

1. `Brain-region automaton mapping`
   - target owner:
     - `Ontology/Brain/BrainRegionAutomatonSurface.agda`
   - scope:
     - bounded region/lens/motif vocabulary and exact packaging only
   - non-claim boundary:
     - no neuroscience completeness claim

2. `Klüver / log-polar visual geometry`
   - target owner:
     - `Ontology/Brain/BrainVisualFormConstantSurface.agda`
   - scope:
     - bounded form-constant / log-polar / open-loop geometry packaging only
   - non-claim boundary:
     - no full V1/V2 recovery claim

3. `Grokking / eigenbasis phase transition`
   - target owner:
     - `Ontology/Brain/BrainLearningEigenbasisSurface.agda`
   - scope:
     - bounded representation-phase-transition packaging only
   - non-claim boundary:
     - no global learning theory claim

4. `Gap junction / morphospace coherence`
   - target owner:
     - `Ontology/Brain/BrainMorphospaceGapJunctionSurface.agda`

   - non-claim boundary:
     - no biological completeness claim

## Why It Appears On The Physics Diagrams

The lane appears on the diagrams for roadmap truthfulness, not because it
currently closes physics theorems here.

It matters because:

- it exerts structural pressure on the crossover lane
- it helps explain why brain-DNA / codec / channel ideas are in scope for the
  broader program
- leaving it out would make the current local physics story look narrower and
  more self-contained than the actual archive-backed program

## Current Non-Claim Boundary

Do not read the brain-side lane as:

- local Agda closure
- current theorem evidence for physics unification
- a finished brain formalism in this repo
- evidence that the sibling-repo brain work has been absorbed here in depth

The honest reading is:

- adjacent lane with theorem-thin local packaging
- sibling-repo informed structural lane
- candidate future source of stronger formalization targets
- now connected into the local crossover/chemistry boundary through a
  theorem-thin extraction-aware connector in `Ontology/BrainDNA/`

The honest theme-by-theme reading is:

- the four brain themes above are present in archive/notebook context
- all four of them are now localized here as bounded theorem-thin owners:
  - region automaton mapping
  - visual form-constant / log-polar geometry
  - grokking / eigenbasis phase transition
  - morphospace gap-junction coherence
- none of them are yet localized here as rich dynamic or consumer-heavy
  theorem lanes

## Concrete Localization Targets Here

1. Strengthen the local brain-side invariant-depth surface beyond the current
   coarse `0/1` bounded law into richer bounded invariant semantics.
2. Extend the now-landed region automaton, visual form-constant,
   grokking/eigenbasis, and morphospace gap-junction surfaces beyond the new
   bounded theme-consumer law surface into richer local semantics.
3. Extend the now-landed extraction-aware connector depth/semantics and
   structural-consumer semantics into stronger local
   crossover semantics over DNA-side structural and chemistry summaries.
4. Keep local brain packaging explicitly adjacent/non-closure while widening
   the set of bounded formalization targets imported from `../dashiBRAIN`.
