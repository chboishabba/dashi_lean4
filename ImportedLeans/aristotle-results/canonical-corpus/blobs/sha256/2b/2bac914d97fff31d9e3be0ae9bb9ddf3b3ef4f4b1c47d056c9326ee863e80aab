-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Round79 removed the arbitrary 17/32 target and proved that any same-norm
-- allocation s+l<1 suffices.  Round80 recovers the older blocked-L2 numerical
-- factor as an exact rational q with q<1/4.  Therefore, if the source-native
-- small branch is <=1/2 and the SAME corrected unified-norm large branch is
-- bounded by that blocked-L2 q, the full one-step cost is actually <3/4.
--
-- This is a strict improvement over merely proving <1 and a much weaker target
-- than the historical 17/32.  The theorem does not identify the old WC3
-- polymer activity with the new unified norm; that one same-object comparison
-- remains the physical analytic seam.
