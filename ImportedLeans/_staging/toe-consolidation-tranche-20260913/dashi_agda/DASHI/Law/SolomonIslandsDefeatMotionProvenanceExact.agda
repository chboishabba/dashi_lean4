-- "DEFEAT THIS MOTION" PROVENANCE BOUNDARY
--
-- Correction after broader source review:
--   * the Australian High Commission -> Francis Sade communication carries
--     treaty/funding progress and "hold steady" language;
--   * separate reporting identifies the downstream coalition exhortation as
--     Sade's own message / a message believed to be from Sade to another
--     Solomon Islands MP.
--
-- Therefore the phrase "stand together to defeat this Motion" must NOT be
-- attributed to Jeffrey Roach or another Australian diplomatic actor absent a
-- stronger primary artifact.  The live question becomes a relay/conditionality
-- question, not a direct-Australian-instruction question.
