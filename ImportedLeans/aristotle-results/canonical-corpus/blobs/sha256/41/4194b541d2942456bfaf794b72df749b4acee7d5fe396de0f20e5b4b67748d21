-- GRADED-FAMILY POINTING / RESIDUAL EQUIVALENCE
--
-- The per-object pointing theorem says a grade-n multiplicity object carries
-- exactly n weighted cells.  Deletion/reinsertion, however, naturally acts on
-- the total family of pointed grade-n objects.  This owner extracts that second
-- level and distinguishes literal equality from domain-chosen extensional
-- equality for proof-bearing carriers.

-- Extensional residual equivalence.
--
-- Many constructive carriers contain proof fields (mass equalities,
-- positivity witnesses, decomposition equations).  Counting and reindexing
-- should not require equality of those proofs.  A domain may therefore state
-- exactly which data determine the pointed object and residual and prove the
-- two round trips with respect to those relations.
