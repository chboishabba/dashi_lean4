module DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadKNCauchyResolvedPhysicalSnapshotRound480Exact where

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ROUND480 / ACTUAL PHYSICAL SNAPSHOT IS WEAKER THAN A UNIFORM OPERATOR BOUND
--
-- R471/R478 expose a useful uniform producer:
--
--   forall c, Q_resolved(c) <= A * M(c).
--
-- But R472's literal downstream payment does not consume every coefficient
-- vector.  A PhysicalFixedOutputGramSnapshot carries one ACTUAL coefficient
-- vector together with exact same-object equalities to the R432 signed cross and
-- fibre budget.  Therefore the least-privilege physical payment is only
--
--   Q_resolved(c_physical) <= A * M(c_physical).
--
-- A uniform R478 bound certainly produces this payment, but it is not mandatory.
-- This owner prevents proof search from quantifying over unused coefficient
-- vectors unless that stronger theorem is genuinely the cheapest producer.
