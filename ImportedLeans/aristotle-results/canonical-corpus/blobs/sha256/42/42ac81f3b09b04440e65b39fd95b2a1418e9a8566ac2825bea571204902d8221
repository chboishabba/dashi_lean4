module DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadKNThreeClassPositiveResidualCompilerRound215Exact where

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ROUND215 / BACKWARD BIDI COMPILER FOR ALL THREE PHYSICAL BONY CLASSES
--
-- Round185 used the sufficient but unnecessarily strong condition that each
-- within-class Gram debt be nonpositive. Round202 later corrected the global
-- contract: positive covariance is admissible when quantitatively bounded.
--
-- This module combines that corrected contract with Round184's universal
-- three-class factor. For a physical three-class signed fibre, it is enough to
-- prove
--
--   D_FL <= R_FL,  D_HH <= R_HH,  D_CC <= R_CC.
--
-- Then
--
--   ||S_FL + S_HH + S_CC||^2
--     <= 3 * ((M_FL+R_FL) + (M_HH+R_HH) + (M_CC+R_CC)).
--
-- Therefore the backward consumer for Package A has no hidden sign theorem:
-- the only remaining classwise mathematics is construction of three physical,
-- cutoff-uniform quartic residual budgets.
