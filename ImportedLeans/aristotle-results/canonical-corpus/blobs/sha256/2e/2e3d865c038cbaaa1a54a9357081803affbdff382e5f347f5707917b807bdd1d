-- POSITIVE/CALIBRATION CLAIM SPECIMEN
--
-- AERO 2023 working-memory section cites Nelson Cowan (2008),
-- "What are the differences between long-term, short-term, and working
-- memory?", Progress in Brain Research 169:323-338,
-- DOI 10.1016/S0079-6123(07)00020-9.
--
-- Cowan's embedded-processes account treats working memory as involving an
-- activated portion of long-term memory with a smaller capacity-limited focus
-- of attention.  This is a useful calibration because important structural
-- predicates in AERO's sentence have genuine source support.  The audit still
-- leaves AERO-specific pedagogical/temporal wording as separate obligations.
