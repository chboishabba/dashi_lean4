# Current Gate Status

## NS/YM/Unification Gate Correction 2026-06-12

Owner: `Codex orchestrator`
Status: `docs-only; fail-closed; non-promoting`

The current cross-lane correction is:

- Navier-Stokes no longer lacks theorem-shape grammar. The repo now carries an
  explicit candidate self-contained packet
  `CKN + ESS + LRT + A1/A3 + A4 + A5-A9`.
  The remaining issue is exact theorem acceptance / promotion in the consumed
  norms and constants, not vague missing structure.
- Unification no longer lacks downstream theorem-shape grammar. The repo now
  carries an explicit candidate package `UCT.1-UCT.8`, with the live wall at
  `UCT.1-UCT.4` and the later clauses structured as downstream consumers.
  The remaining issue is acceptance / promotion of that package, not missing
  consumer shape.
- Yang-Mills remains categorically different. The exact theorem chain is
  explicit, but the load-bearing remaining missing-content burden is still the
  Balaban-centered `H3a` cluster and its RG/continuum consequences.

This correction changes no Agda theorem flag. It only aligns the repo's
human-facing gate summary with the sharper packet surfaces already present.

## Canonical Reading Rule 2026-06-12

Owner: `Codex orchestrator`
Status: `docs-only; fail-closed; non-promoting`

This file now has a strict interpretation rule:

- Treat the `2026-06-12` correction above as the canonical current-state
  reading for the Clay-facing NS/YM/unification lanes.
- Read older sections below as historical governance notes, route archives,
  or legacy blocker maps unless they explicitly restate the same sharpened
  posture.
- In particular, older notes about broad NS missing-structure fronts,
  broad unification consumer-shape gaps, or many equal-rank YM continuum
  blockers are not the freshest statement of the repo.

Current canonical split:

- NS: explicit candidate self-contained packet exists; remaining burden is
  promotion evidence / theorem acceptance.
- Unification: explicit candidate `UCT.1-UCT.8` package exists; remaining
  burden is promotion evidence focused on `UCT.1-UCT.4`.
- YM: the live missing-content burden stays the Balaban-centered `H3a`
  cluster if an internal proof is demanded.

## Promotion Probe Layer 2026-06-12

Owner: `Codex orchestrator`
Status: `code + docs; fail-closed; non-promoting`

The repo now carries a separate root-probe layer under
`DASHI/Physics/Probes/`. The purpose is not to promote any theorem. The
purpose is to ask a narrower question:

- if the current canonical NS, YM, unification, or cross-lane root receipt had
  to promote right now, what is the first strengthened assertion that fails?

Operational rule:

- `DASHI/Everything.agda` remains the aggregate green integration target.
- The probe modules are intentionally outside `Everything`.
- Directly compiling a probe is allowed to fail, and that failure is the
  desired blocker signal.

Canonical cutset surfaces:

- Agda receipt: `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PromotionProbeCutsetReceipt.agda`
- Runner: `scripts/run_promotion_probe_cutset.sh`
- JSON harness: `scripts/promotion_probe_cutset_harness.py`

Current recorded run shape:

- `DASHI/Everything.agda`: `PASS`
- `NSPromotionProbe`: `FAIL`
- `YMPromotionProbe`: `FAIL`
- `UnificationPromotionProbe`: `FAIL`
- `CurrentProofProfilePromotionProbe`: `FAIL`

The intended operational invariant is now explicit:

- aggregate build green
- root probes red
- root blocker cutset extracted from those four red surfaces

## Worker 4 Termination/YM Lane Governance 2026-06-01

Owner: `Worker 4`
Status: `docs-only; fail-closed; non-promoting`

The current termination-energy decision is fail-closed: v3/cascade flux is
diagnostic-only and is removed from termination energy `E/Q`.  The live
termination lanes are v2 and v7.

The `NS->EV5` lane revision remains empirical.  It may produce diagnostics,
projection targets, and comparison obligations, but it does not transfer
finite carrier estimates to actual Navier-Stokes flow and does not imply
Sobolev/Serrin or Clay closure.

For Yang-Mills, KP/Balaban is the preferred carrier-side next attack.  This
preference does not prove `exactDecorrelation`, KP uniform-volume bounds,
large-field tails, Balaban induction, continuum OS/Wightman reconstruction,
or a Clay mass gap.

## Worker 5 Corrected YM Competitive Path 2026-06-01

Owner: `Worker 5`
Status: `governance-only; fail-closed; non-promoting`

The current Clay Yang-Mills path is narrowed to three hard mathematical
problems:

1. Balaban volume-independent induction for the constructive/infinite-volume
   route.
2. BRST-compatible reflection positivity for the gauge-fixed continuum
   physical sector.
3. An operator-valued continuum spectral-gap theorem for the reconstructed
   physical Yang-Mills Hamiltonian or transfer generator.

Dependency graph:

```text
Balaban volume-independent induction
  -> BRST reflection positivity
  -> operator-valued spectral gap
  -> Clay YM existence and mass gap
```

Finite carrier gaps, scalar pressure inequalities, strong-coupling lattice
diagnostics, and transfer-matrix gaps remain evidence only.  The specific
inference "`14 < 15`; therefore Yang-Mills mass gap" is rejected: the
pressure-below-15 surface is a bounded carrier diagnostic and does not supply
continuum construction, BRST/OS positivity, Wightman reconstruction, operator
convergence, or a physical mass spectrum.

## Manager C Clay Closure Target Sync 2026-05-29

Owner: `Manager C`
Status: `Agda-backed hard-target sync; fail-closed; non-promoting`

This sync records the exact mathematical targets required before any Clay
Yang-Mills or Navier-Stokes closure claim could be made in DASHI.

- Four-receipt state for the Paper 8 Millennium lanes:
  `CarrierFactorVecInjectivityOSPositivityReceipt` records finite-depth
  carrier OS positivity from FactorVec depth-step injectivity, and
  `UltrametricSobolevUniformBoundReceipt` records ultrametric Sobolev
  uniformity under citation authority.  These are positive finite/uniformity
  receipts only.  The Carrier RG scale / dimensionful mass-gap convergence
  receipt remains open, and the Carrier NS smooth convergence / ultrametric
  Aubin-Lions receipt remains open.
- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ClayMillenniumClosureTargetReceipt` now records the
  YM closing target as carrier OS positivity, a uniform depth-independent mass
  gap, interacting continuum Yang-Mills construction, and Wightman
  reconstruction.  Current flags keep `osPositivityConstructed = false`,
  `uniformDepthIndependentGapConstructed = false`,
  `wightmanReconstructionApplied = false`, and `clayYangMillsClosed = false`.
  The finite-depth OS positivity receipt does not change those Clay target
  flags; the missing Carrier RG scale / dimensionful mass-gap convergence
  theorem remains the exact promotion blocker.
- The same receipt records the NS closing target as uniform carrier
  enstrophy/BKM control and the continuum BKM regularity passage.  Current
  flags keep `uniformEnstrophyControlConstructed = false`,
  `uniformVorticityLInfinityControlConstructed = false`,
  `continuumBKMRegularityPassageConstructed = false`, and
  `clayNavierStokesClosed = false`.
  The ultrametric Sobolev uniformity receipt does not change those Clay target
  flags; the missing Carrier NS smooth convergence / ultrametric Aubin-Lions
  theorem remains the exact promotion blocker.
- `MillenniumTowerYangMillsInstanceReceipt` and
  `MillenniumTowerNavierStokesInstanceReceipt` consume these targets, so Paper
  8 can cite the hard blocker receipts directly rather than relying on prose
  blocker language.
- No Paper 1 claim changes are needed from this sync: the change is a Paper 8 /
  Millennium-tower claim-governance refinement, not a new physics promotion.

## Worker C Docs-Ledger Sync 2026-05-29

Owner: `Worker C-docs-ledger`
Status: `docs-only Paper 8 ledger refresh; fail-closed; non-promoting`

This sync records the newest read-first posture for Paper 1 and Paper 8
coordination. It changes no Agda surface, constructs no authority token, and
does not edit `Docs/Paper8UnificationDraft.md`.

Current package state:

- Paper 1 is now a narrow constructive physics-unification package, not a
  completed-unification or empirical-closure paper. The current manuscript
  skeleton is `Docs/Paper1DraftSkeleton.md` and the admissible positive claims
  remain bounded to exact internal receipts: G2 direction-indexed schema
  adoption, official tracked G6 commuting/above-threshold consumers, G3
  constructive finite-support subtraction support, and E8 integer/local
  boundary status. W2/W3/W4/W5, non-flat GR, Schwarzschild, continuum, GRQFT,
  limited SM+GR, and full unification remain excluded.
- The Temple-Alexander-Vogler receipt is present as
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FriedmannInstabilitySaddleReceipt.agda`. It records a
  literature boundary for pressureless Friedmann instability/saddle behavior.
  It is not a dark-energy result, does not remove dark energy, does not falsify
  LCDM, and does not promote sourced GR or cosmology closure.
- Gate 6 now has a conditional DHR/SM promotion frontier in
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/ConditionalGDHRSMPromotionReceipt.agda`: the status moves
  to `conditionalOnDRAuthority` for the finite prime-lane witnesses, while
  `unconditionalGDHREqualsGSMPromoted = false`. Actual arbitrary DHR
  endomorphism algebras, full hexagon/statistics closure, DR compact-group
  reconstruction, and exact `G_DHR ~= G_SM` remain unpromoted.
- Gate 7 now carries alpha/Yukawa target receipts in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CarrierYukawaRatioTargetReceipt.agda`. The alpha
  readback is explicitly non-promoting: accepted-alpha target value/bound and
  physical-value promotion are false. Off-diagonal/non-diagonal Yukawa
  promotion remains blocked by missing charged-lepton Yukawa carriers,
  physical fermion mass receipts, running/threshold conventions, W4 Higgs-scale
  calibration, actual DHR sector representations, non-identity intertwiners,
  and physical Yukawa matrices.
- Gate 5 P5' is now recorded as a stronger artifact-binding state but still
  non-promoting. `PenguinDecayLHCbChecksumAcceptedResidualReceipt` records the
  selected value/covariance checksum receipts and a residual vector status
  with signed pulls `[4,6] -> -2.8 sigma` and `[6,8] -> -3.0 sigma`, classified
  only as borderline/anomaly candidate. `acceptedResidualCandidate = false`,
  anomaly/discovery authority is absent, and carrier-derived C9 remains a
  prediction target rather than accepted new physics.

Hard overclaim prohibitions for all downstream summaries:

- no Clay Yang-Mills or Navier-Stokes solution claim;
- no dark-energy removal and no LCDM falsification claim;
- no full Standard Model reconstruction, full unification, limited SM+GR
  closure, or GRQFT closure;
- no accepted new-physics claim from P5', C9/C10, alpha, Yukawa, CKM, DHR, or
  Temple/Friedmann receipts.

Date: `2026-05-22`
Owner: `Worker PaperReadinessIntegrator documentation/audit sidecar`
Status: `fail-closed cross-gate sync; historical notes retained below`

This sidecar records the current gate state after the latest orchestration so a
future worker can recover the blocker posture without reading the full chat
history. It is a documentation summary only. It does not close any gate,
construct any token, or replace targeted Agda validation.

## Publication-Readiness Sync 2026-05-29

This sync is documentation-only. It records the newest publication posture for
the Paper 1 and Paper 8 readiness surfaces and keeps every terminal promotion
fail-closed.

- Temple/Alexander/Vogler Friedmann receipt: the Gate 4 authority boundary is
  now recorded through
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.FriedmannInstabilitySaddleReceipt.canonicalFriedmannInstabilitySaddleReceipt`.
  The receipt binds the 2026 Proc. R. Soc. A authority metadata, DOI
  `10.1098/rspa.2025.0912`, local PDF SHA256
  `a105917e23d118c6c41004292c2ecb2a32f042dec738ccd2c380253e0eace6cf`,
  and the external theorem statement that pressureless Friedmann spacetimes
  are unstable to radial perturbation in Einstein-Euler self-similar variables
  with the critical Friedmann spacetime an unstable saddle rest point. It
  consumes the contracted-Bianchi matter closure and Wald GR authority
  boundary only as fail-closed preconditions. It does not identify
  `xi = r/t` with DASHI carrier depth, does not complete continuum existence
  theory or observational cosmology comparison, and keeps
  `darkEnergyRemoved = false`, `LCDMFalsified = false`, and
  `cosmologyPromoted = false`.
- Paper 1 package: Paper 1 remains paper-ready only as a formal
  receipt-system / constructive physics-unification architecture paper. The
  admissible positive package is the typed claim ledger, inhabited bounded
  receipt surfaces, exact blockers, and reproducibility/governance appendix.
  It may cite G2 schema extension, official tracked G6 commuting and
  above-threshold consumers, bounded constructive G3 support, E8 local/upstream
  boundary accounting, Drell-Yan bounded W3 comparison plus strict-log failure
  diagnosis, and formal bridge-obligation ledgers. It must not claim Clay
  Yang-Mills, Standard Model derivation, empirical authority, GR recovery,
  sourced Einstein law, limited SM+GR, GRQFT closure, or completed
  unification.
- Gate 6 conditional state: finite p2/p3/p5 prime-lane DHR carrier receipts,
  finite carrier-level localized endomorphism receipts, finite braiding
  naturality, the five DHR/DR internal axiom receipt kinds, original DHR
  authority, and Tannaka fibre-functor authority are now recorded in the
  conditional package
  `DASHI.Physics.QFT.ConditionalGDHRSMPromotionReceipt.canonicalConditionalGDHRSMPromotionReceipt`.
  The current status is `conditionalOnDRAuthority`, not an unconditional
  theorem. Arbitrary-sector generalization, internal compact gauge-group
  construction, concrete `G_DHR -> G_SM`, exact Standard Model carrier-functor
  match, and full theorem-in-repo promotion remain blocked.
- Gate 7 alpha/off-diagonal Yukawa state: Gate 7 remains a carrier diagnostic
  frontier. `CarrierYukawaRatioTargetReceipt` records alpha readback
  diagnostics `0.041240` and `0.085720` from p2-p3 and p3-p5 finite DHR/SM
  carrier-dimension separations, but accepted alpha, supplied alpha bound, and
  physical-value promotion remain false. `YukawaFromCarrier` records
  symbolic upper-triangular up-sector off-diagonal carrier entries
  `y12 = 1/5`, `y13 = 1/25`, and `y23 = 1/5` as inter-lane/depth-suppressed
  Gaussian rational data. These entries are not physical Yukawa values:
  physical coupling scale, physical Yukawa matrices, DHR physical sector
  representations, physical weak/mass-basis identification, CKM promotion, and
  W4 Higgs/VEV authority remain missing.
- Gate 5 P5' state: the active penguin lane is a fail-closed prediction target,
  not an anomaly or discovery claim. The current target receipt is
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PenguinDecayC9C10P5PrimePredictionTargetReceipt.canonicalC9C10P5PrimePredictionTargetReceipt`.
  It records P5' as an angular `b -> s mu+ mu-` C9/C10 target, threads CKM-loop
  and carrier-Yukawa surfaces, records the 2025 full Run 1+2 LHCb public P5'
  target, rejects the claimed `HEPData 160745` primary route as b-jet-mass data,
  records the older 2020 LHCb route as fallback provenance, and now threads the
  current P5' value/correlation checksum surfaces. The residual vector
  artifact, accepted CKM source authority, physical Yukawa promotion, accepted
  C9/C10 Wilson digest, C1/C2 charm-loop authority, freeze/no-posterior-tuning
  authority, and accepted residual prerequisites remain missing. Without
  authority, the residual law still returns `insufficientAuthority`; no
  accepted anomaly claim or new-physics promotion is constructed.

## Current Publishability Boundary Digest 2026-05-27

Prediction-frontier sync `2026-05-28`:

- A withdrawn 5D constructive YM candidate is carried only as non-promoting route evidence for the
  Yang-Mills mass-gap frontier.  It does not supply reflection positivity,
  polymer-cluster convergence, OS reconstruction, Hamiltonian spectral lift, or
  Clay acceptance.
- Gate 5 penguin contact remains blocked at the selected LHCb
  value/covariance-table/checksum authority and full freeze-tuple population.
  CMS checksum data is candidate evidence only and does not promote the
  selected LHCb lane.  The current public LHCb target is the 2025 full Run 1+2
  `B0 -> K*0 mu+ mu-` result (`LHCb-PAPER-2025-041` / `arXiv:2512.18053` /
  `CDS:2951844`).  The 2020 `HEPData:ins1798504` result is fallback-only;
  `HEPData 160745` is recorded as a mismatch/fail-closed lead because the
  supplied/reachable artifacts identify `ins2922449` b-jet mass Table 16.  The
  attempted `ins2101841` route is stale negative provenance; the CERN
  repository page is route evidence only.
- Gate 6 DHR/SM work is an end-sector computation target over the finite
  p2/p3/p5 matrices.  The finite carrier matrix target computation,
  finite carrier-level star/composition/associativity receipts, finite
  lane-local category laws, finite conjugate/dual identity zigzags, finite
  tensor target wiring, finite braiding naturality, finite left/right hexagon
  target receipts, and finite statistics-as-braiding target receipt are now
  inhabited.  Actual arbitrary DHR localised endomorphism algebras, arbitrary
  DHR hexagon closure, statistics-as-braiding in the full DHR category, DR
  theorem application, compact-group reconstruction, and `G_DHR ~= G_SM`
  remain unconstructed.
- `C9/P5'` is a non-promoting prediction target, not a discovery claim.  Wilson
  authority, selected LHCb data, residual-vector construction, frozen
  projection inputs, and anomaly-claim authority remain missing.  The
  carrier-derived `C9_NP` constraint target is wired but cannot consume the
  2025 public result, 2020 fallback, or rejected 160745 route without those
  authorities, so it remains non-promoting.

Second-wave factual state:

- full aggregate validation passed with the full include path:
  `timeout 300s agda -i . -i DCHoTT-Agda -i cubical -l standard-library DASHI/Everything.agda`;
- the CMS HEPData `Results` table for record `ins2616304` v1 / table
  `1435213` now has a typed SHA256 authority-candidate receipt:
  `08a244d15702168288d1bf414423bcbc05c5c176c229280b2e185c5cd0bee9eb`;
- the thread-selected LHCb penguin lane remains fail-closed because the 2025
  Run 1+2 target has no accepted value/covariance HEPData table checksum or
  residual-vector/freeze authority here; the 2020 HEPData fallback is
  non-promoting, and `HEPData 160745` is rejected unless record/table binding
  to P5' is proved;
- the Doplicher-Roberts authority receipt is recorded and consumable only after
  evidence; it keeps `drAuthorityConsumedHere = false` and Standard Model
  matching promotion false;
- Gate 8 partial composition consumes the new DHR/DR, finite Stone/YM, finite
  GR/W4, and penguin freeze receipts, but its promotion bit remains false and
  Paper 7 remains non-constructible.

This tranche improves publishability by narrowing the claim boundary, not by
promoting the physics program. The repo-facing statement is now:

- local subconditions have been discharged where the Agda surfaces explicitly
  say so: penguin empirical-contact wiring, conditional residual
  classification under accepted prerequisites, selected lower Yang-Mills
  identity/flat-support witnesses, local GR valuation and stress-energy
  component subconditions, bounded S8 energy-order adapter routes, finite
  Paper 3 traversal/completeness shadows, and Higgs/CKM request refinements;
- those discharges are subcondition or adapter discharges only. They do not
  inhabit the global theorem, accepted authority token, external calibration,
  or terminal composition objects;
- the penguin lane now has a clean authority discriminator: an
  `acceptedResidualCandidate` classification is admissible only after
  authority, freeze, data, and controlled-theory prerequisites are present.
  With `authorityMissing`, the canonical outcome remains
  `insufficientAuthority`.

The exact hard boundaries that still block stronger publication language are:

- W2: no constructor or accepted exact hook for
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`;
- W3: no constructor, provider token, or accepted exact hook for
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`;
- W4/W5: no accepted DY luminosity/convention authority, W4 adequacy receipt,
  Candidate256 physical calibration receipt, or W5 correction authority;
- penguin: CMS HEPData `Results` checksum is supplied and typed as candidate
  data, but the selected 2025 LHCb P5' thread checksum remains missing; the
  2020 HEPData fallback is non-promoting, and the `HEPData 160745` /
  `ins2922449` Table 16 artifacts are rejected b-jet-mass data.  There is
  still no accepted flavio digest, C9/C10 Wilson digest, CKM source authority,
  full freeze tuple population, projection-code hash, or no-posterior-tuning
  attestation;
- Paper 4/Yang-Mills: no global spectral-gap theorem, non-flat field-strength
  fibre action, covariant Bianchi transport, Hodge/current coupling, or
  Euler-Lagrange `D * F = J` theorem;
- Paper 5/GR: no inhabited non-flat CRT/local boundary semantic realization,
  Ricci/Einstein continuum convergence, W4 stress-energy interface, sourced
  Einstein law, or Schwarzschild/weak-field recovery;
- Paper 3: no physical Hilbert quotient, reversible traversal group, strong
  continuity, Stone bundle, or self-adjoint generator promotion;
- Paper 6/7: a DR authority receipt and Gate 8 partial-composition receipt
  exist, but they are fail-closed for Standard Model matching and terminal
  promotion; there is still no DHR hexagon closure, Higgs nonzero-VEV/W4
  calibration, CKM mixing theorem, Standard Model reconstruction, Clay
  authority, or terminal Paper 7 promotion.

Therefore the current strongest honest packaging is a fail-closed formal
roadmap with typed subcondition progress and exact blockers. Paper 7 remains
an obligation/composition ledger only; it is not promoted.

## Current Tranche C Snapshot 2026-05-22

The tranche-C worker lanes landed concrete, fail-closed consumer modules for
the depth-9 Gate 3 geometry and the Gate 4 contracted-Bianchi/stress-energy
adapter layer. The new modules are:

- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DiscreteFormsOnDepth9.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Depth9ConnectionAndCurvature.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/FieldStrengthTransportOnGaugeBundle.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/HodgeVariationPairingDepth9.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractedBianchiMatterClosure.agda`

`DASHI/Physics/Closure/CrossGateCompositionTheorems.agda` was also updated so
Gate 8 explicitly consumes the current fail-closed cross-gate consistency
receipt. `DASHI/Everything.agda` now imports the new tranche-C modules and
passes after validation. The new surfaces are honest wrappers or consumers,
not fake promotions: Gate 3 transport/variation remains fail-closed at the
exact Yang-Mills blockers, and Gate 4 remains fail-closed at the GR/W4
boundary.

## Current Tranche Snapshot 2026-05-22

The current tranche sync is fail-closed and now matches the local compile
record. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CrossGateConsistency.agda` and
`DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRGaugeReceiptSurface.agda` typecheck and now thread the
typed Clay/YM, Higgs/PDG, and DHR thermodynamic-limit boundary receipts as
explicit integration fields while keeping `gate8Promotable = false` and the
Gate 1/Gate 6 obstruction open. The current aggregate check is green:
`DASHI/Everything.agda` now passes after the new boundary-threading receipts
were added. The Stone tranche modules remain locally validated, but the
remaining global blockers stay open: `missingExactStandardModelCarrierFunctorMatch`,
`missingUnitarityResidualWitness`,
`missingNonFlatSFGCSite2DConnectionCurvature`,
`missingLieAlgebraCarrierForSelectedFiniteGaugeSector`,
`missingFieldStrengthTransportActionOnSelectedGaugeBundle`, and
`missingVariationPairingForSelectedHodgeStar`.
The new boundary receipt surfaces are now in the build as typed, fail-closed
anchors: `ClayYMGapBoundary`, `HiggsPDGBoundary`, and
`DHRThermodynamicLimitBoundary`. The existing
`DASHI/Physics/QFT/DHRThermodynamicLimit.agda` surface now threads the typed
thermodynamic-limit boundary receipt as an explicit integration field.
The current tranche also now carries the boundary-parameter adapter algebra and
the W3 gauge-sector refinement algebra as typed fail-closed receipts; both are
recorded as boundary-only, non-promoting surfaces.
Gate 7 now also exposes explicit exact bridge records in
`CKMCarrierMixingReceipt.agda` and `HiggsElectroweakBoundary.agda`; they carry
the exact witness chain and the `v_Higgs` adapter4 bit as typed fail-closed
witnesses, not promotions.
Gate 2 now also has a theorem-shaped package:
`Gate2SpectralGapMath` factors the canonical Bool-model finite coercivity,
refinement inequality, and Nat-colimit gap lift into reusable lemma records
while keeping the continuum Yang-Mills mass-gap claim boundary-only.
The current tranche also adds an actual selected-carrier Gate 2 bundle:
`Gate2ActualSelectedCarrierBundle` threads the finite coercivity, tower
refinement, uniform lower bound, self-adjoint wrapper, and Hamiltonian
colimit lift receipts through the blueprint as typed fail-closed data.
The current tranche also now carries a four-program blueprint bundle for Gate
2 spectral-gap refinement, Gate 3 non-flat Yang-Mills geometry, Gate 4
contracted-Bianchi/stress-energy compatibility, and Gate 7 carrier-derived CKM
as typed fail-closed program records. These are structure-bearing receipts, not
promotions.
Gate 3 now additionally has a concrete `YangMillsGate3DiscreteGeometryReceipt`
surface that packages the finite SFGC 0/1/2-form carriers, the depth-9
connection, the non-flat curvature witness, the variation-pairing frontier,
and the canonical W3/SU3 bridge witnesses as typed fail-closed fields.
The new reusable math packages now exist as first-class modules:
`SpectralGapRefinementStability` packages the finite spectral-gap toolkit,
refinement monotonicity, lower-bound persistence, and Nat colimit transfer;
`DHRSectorFunctoriality` packages localised endomorphisms, intertwiners,
transportability, tensor composition, and reconstruction compatibility against
the thermodynamic-limit boundary.
The current upstream receipts for DHR identity-action semantics, DHR sector
decomposition, filtered-colimit preservation, the one-point GNS/Stone bridge,
the strong-continuity front, and the mod-19 SU(3) clock/shift route remain
compiled upstream frontiers only; they do not promote the blocker list.
The SU(3) depth-quotient bridge and the FN/Wolfenstein CKM front-end remain
compiled witness bundles, not terminal promotions.

## Current Tranche Note 2026-05-18

This read-first update records the last two documentation tranches only and
does not rewrite older status history.

- W3 is now represented by a governance-action request surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenGovernanceActionRequest.agda`.
  It requests either an exact constructor at the canonical definition site or a
  non-postulated exact policy hook. It does not construct
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, so accepted W3 empirical authority remains
  fail-closed.
- W4/W5 authority accounting has been corrected around the CMS
  `36.3 fb^-1` luminosity boundary and the accepted/replacement authority packet
  shape. The worktree includes
  `scripts/data/authority_packet.accepted_replacement.schema.json` and
  `tests/test_w4w5_fail_closed_authority_packets.py`; these are fail-closed
  schema/test surfaces, not accepted DY convention authority. W4/W5 remain
  blocked on an accepted provider/governance payload.
- Moonshine/`laneDimension`, W9, G6, and GR now have typechecked surfaces in
  the current validation round through `DASHI/Everything.agda`. The
  Moonshine/`laneDimension` wording is limited to the
  `DASHIPrimeLaneEquivClosureReceiptSurface` / `DASHIPrimeLaneEquiv` bridge
  route; W9 is limited to the existing MDL-seam-bounded
  `canonicalMDLTerminationSeamW9KillReceipt` surface; G6 is limited to the
  tracked `G6OfficialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingTheorem` route; and GR is limited
  to candidate/sidecar surfaces such as
  `GRDiscreteRicciCandidateFromCurvature`. No terminal, Clay, W4/W5 authority,
  full GR, GRQFT, or TOE promotion follows.

## Formal Model

- O: paper-readiness documentation integrator.
- R: reflect the latest exact surfaces for G2 schema extension, G6 official
  tracked commuting, G3 certified subtraction support, E8 upstream blockers,
  GR adapter boundary, and governance fail-closed authority gates without
  promoting code.
- C: docs-only status synchronization in `Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md` and
  `Docs/LimitedSMGRPaperReadinessMatrix.md`; no Agda edits and no promotion
  edits.
- S: many active surfaces are untracked or worker-owned. Current grep/status
  shows a real G6 official tracked theorem and G3 certified-support route, but
  W2/W3/W4 authorities, old G6 `LaneOperator` full promotion, upstream E8
  promotion, concrete GR adapter bundle, and sourced GR remain open.
- L: `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` remains the long ledger; this document is
  the short read-first status layer.
- P: future workers should advance a lane only by inhabiting the named receipt,
  theorem, authority token, or typed request surface.
- G: governance-first. External tokens are not fabricated. W2/W3 authority-token
  datatypes remain constructorless until an accepted exact hook or external
  value inhabits the required type.
- F: gaps below are blockers, not prose task notes.

## Current Gate Posture

| Gate / lane | Current state | Exact remaining blocker |
|---|---|---|
| 15SSP scalarization / post-entropy bridge | `Ontology.GodelScalarization` and `Ontology.GodelScalarizationTransportDerived` now provide the scalar `G : FactorVec -> Nat` and the derived signed transport law over the 15 SSP lanes. The bridge modules expose the formal path through post-entropy/MDL geometry, physical projection, falsifiable lane surfaces, and concrete prediction receipts. The new boundary records explicitly mark the post-entropy universality and formal-compression bridge as witness interfaces, not global TOE closure proofs. | The scalarization gap is closed for the current signed transport API, but global post-entropy universality still needs a derived finite-sublevel/well-founded attractor proof rather than an externally supplied `attractorWitness`. Physical closure remains gated by G3/G6/GR/W4/W5 receipts below. |
| Cross-domain variational spine | `CrossDomainVariationalSpine` defines the typed object `(X, delta, pi, defect, gate, observation, symmetry)` and records molecular PES minima, bonding projection/defect density, resonance MDL projection, biological attractors, and Kluver perceptual orbit classes as structurally composable theorem targets. The canonical boundary allows the claim that physics, chemistry, biology, and perception share a typed projection-defect / MDL spine. | This is a structural bridge only. Quantitative calibration, universality proof, computational tractability, chemistry/biology/perception empirical prediction receipts, and cross-domain recovery equivalence remain missing. No chemistry closure, bonding theorem, molecular spectrum, protein-folding result, biology prediction, perception fit, or TOE promotion follows from this boundary alone. |
| Drell-Yan adjacent-ratio empirical lane | `DrellYanAdjacentRatioEmpiricalLaneReceipt` attaches the existing W3 t43/t44 comparison-law receipt to the new FactorVec falsification-lane surface. It records `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176`, `mean pred/data = 0.9941233097`, frozen commit/digest fields from W3, zero fitted parameters after the projection receipt, and a strict-threshold witness that `chi2/dof <= 2` is not passed. The script runner now also has a fail-closed `t43-strict-log` mode; `DrellYanStrictLogLinearSubspaceReceipt` records the corrected diagnosis. Current predictors fail strict threshold at `chi2/dof = 283.4574` and `3180.2117`; diagonal-only log chi2/dof is larger (`326.0905` / `5219.4185`), so off-diagonal covariance is not the inflation source. Leading inverse-covariance mode fractions are small (`0.0066` / `0.0126`), while the `1, log(phiStar)` subspace accounts for most chi2 (`0.8905` / `0.9687`). | This is empirical contact plus a negative strict diagnostic, not strict falsification-lane success. It remains bounded to CMS-SMP-20-003 / HEPData `ins2079374/t43` with `t44` covariance and does not supply W3 accepted authority, W4/W5 DY convention authority, above-Z promotion, or physical calibration. The next predictor route is `StrictPassOrthogonalityObligation` plus a frozen depth-averaged curvature kernel: remove log-linear slope/intercept and prove the residual complement bound. |
| Brain / fMRI perception observation quotient | `BrainConnectomeFMRIObservationQuotient` refines the perception lane into `phase orbit class -> neural state initialization -> connectome-constrained processing -> high-resolution/laminar fMRI readout -> behavioral report`. It records the DASHI brain object `B = (C, N, P, O)`, the formal brain carrier target `X_brain = (V,E,W,sigma)`, connectome carrier `C = (V,E,W,Lambda)`, ternary neuronal state, connectome-constrained threshold transition, MDL processing energy, connectome symmetry quotient, processing orbit quotient, inverse observation target, laminar readout factorization, and same-orbit / different-orbit fMRI separation tests for Kluver form constants. | This is an empirical observation quotient target only. Missing receipts are connectome dataset, neural transition calibration, laminar/high-resolution fMRI protocol, phase-orbit stimulus protocol, behavioral-report binding, separation metric/threshold, and empirical comparison run. No fMRI validation, connectome determinism, perception closure, cognition closure, or consciousness claim follows. |
| Developmental genomic inverse bridge | `DevelopmentalGenomicInverseBridge` records DNA/genome as a generator of developmental constraints, not a phenotype blueprint. It packages the forward chain `g -> R_t -> M_t -> N_t -> C_t -> T_C -> sigma_t -> O(sigma_t)` and the inverse condition-probing chain `DeltaY -> DeltaO -> DeltaT_C -> DeltaC -> DeltaM -> DeltaR -> candidate Delta g`. The inverse surface ranks a candidate regulatory fibre by phenotype residual, MDL perturbation, pleiotropy, and layer-constraint penalties. It now also records named biomedical calibration-fixture slots for HBB, CFTR, CCR5-Delta32, PCSK9, LCT enhancer, HOX/SHH, FOXP2, and APOE, plus synthetic construct fixture slots for GFP/RFP reporters, metabolic odor, and short-vs-long pathway tests through `SyntheticConstructCarrier` and `SyntheticBiologyInverse`. | This is a non-promoting theorem-target boundary. Missing receipts are genome dataset, regulatory graph, developmental dynamics calibration, morphogenesis dataset, neural-lineage differentiation, connectome formation, environment/intervention binding, phenotype-condition signal, inverse-projection/backprop proof, candidate-ranking validation, calibration-fixture ground truth, fixture-ranking proof, layered residual compatibility, fibre-refinement proof, laminar narrowing receipt, synthetic construct library, synthetic forward model, synthetic phenotype measurement, synthetic burden measurement, synthetic compatibility penalty, synthetic ranking validation, and natural/synthetic score bridge. Named fixtures are frozen calibration-test targets only; they do not validate any gene, condition, pathway, brain mechanism, wet-lab construct, CRISPR design, metabolic pathway, host-safety claim, or natural biology inference. No DNA blueprint, one-gene-causes-condition, disease-gene validation, biology closure, cognition closure, or perception closure follows. |
| `W4` physical calibration / W4-W5 DY authority | Blocked and non-promoting. The local scaled Z adequacy inequality is discharged, and the luminosity/Z-adequacy policy-hook request now also exists at the canonical `W4ZAdequacyReceipt` definition site. Public CMS/HEPData evidence is recorded only as a fail-closed self-population attempt. The new `canonicalW4AuthorityClosureRouteAudit` preserves that public evidence while rejecting public-source self-issued W4 authority, local shadow records, and local `postulate` to `record` rewrites without owner/governance approval. W4Docs inspection found no canonical constructor and no accepted exact token-producing policy hook for `DASHI.Physics.Closure.W4ZAdequacyReceipt.AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`; the same-name provider-response skeleton remains a separate constructorless, insufficient receipt surface. | Exact first missing remains `missingAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`. Queue remains `AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority -> W4ZAdequacy -> Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt`, then `matterFieldFromW4` and `stressEnergyTensorFromW4`. The canonical authority type remains constructorless; the current W2/W3 self-issuance policy explicitly does not authorize W4/W5 DY convention or physical-unit authority. The only accepted closure route is an exact provider/governance hook returning the canonical authority type, or an owner-approved constructor in that canonical module. |
| `G6` cross-lane commuting | Paper-usable on the tracked route, not fully promoted. The tracked `GL.FactorVec` carrier now has real `setValuation`, `valuationOfSetAt`, `valuationOfSetAtOther`, and `setValCommutes`. Raw scaling actions commute, `NontrivialTrackedLaneOperator` has a concrete tracked scaling inhabitant, `G6NontrivialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingReceipt` is consumable, and `G6OfficialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingTheorem` plus official above-threshold tracked consumers expose the current positive theorem surface. | Full G6 promotion is still blocked by the live `LaneOperator` interface: `opSharedLaneActionIdentityWhenVanishes` has a universal `Nat`-prime form that blocks nontrivial scaling. The remaining decision is to migrate old `LaneOperator` consumers to `G6OfficialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingTheorem`/tracked above-threshold APIs or split the old law into outside-basis coordinate identity plus tracked-prime locality. |
| `G3` phi-identification / Schrodinger | Advanced, not promoted. Selected carrier, concrete operators, pointwise wave-function laws, matrix elements, p2 valuation, constructive finite-support subtype, finite-support norm-index degree soundness, witness-relative difference norm surfaces, a subtraction support candidate, certified subtraction support, and the selected associated-graded prequotient surface now exist. `G3AssociatedGradedQuotientSurface` additionally records `G3AssociatedGradedProjectionInterface`, a projection-only target from selected `F_n` pieces into an abstract graded-class surface. | Arbitrary `WaveFunctionOperator` support remains fail-closed at `missingGlobalFiniteNonzeroMatrixSupportWitness`. For the associated-graded route, the projection interface is not a quotient construction: accepted equivalence modulo previous filtration, accepted quotient carrier `F_n / F_{n-1}`, projection-respects-equivalence inhabitant, and p2-indexed Poincare/Galilei isomorphism remain missing. The norm/valuation/product/bracket blockers also remain open for full Schrodinger promotion. |
| `G2` SFGC schema extension / direction-indexed adoption | Direction-indexed schema adoption is complete for core consumers. `CoreDirectionIndexedSFGCSchema`, canonical `SFGCSite2D` adoption, aliases, and an adoption receipt now exist; `G2SFGCGaugeFieldSchemaExtension` proves `noRemainingG2SFGCSchemaExtensionMissing`. | No remaining G2 SFGC schema-extension blocker is recorded. This does not promote Maxwell curvature or a field-equation carrier. Optional future policy: whether to literally widen the legacy `SFGCSite`/`SFGCShiftEdge` names, which are preserved as right-only compatibility surfaces. |
| `E8` / LILA root enumeration | Advanced, not fully promoted. Integer upstream completeness has landed via `integerIndexedRootsCompleteForTwoSparseShapeTheorem`, the local integer/half/combined semantic finite surface is wired to the upstream obstruction, and `E8UpstreamCompleteReceiptPromotionAudit` records the exact upstream definition site and impossibility eliminator. | The remaining blocker is upstream ownership: `missingPromotionFromLocalSemanticFiniteCompletenessToUpstreamCompleteReceipt`, recorded under `missingUpstreamE8RootEnumerationCompletePromotion`. Upstream `E8RootEnumerationComplete` is empty/constructorless here; upstream must add a legitimate constructor or promotion API after discharging `remainingConcreteProofObligations` and `remainingEnumerationObligations`, especially `halfIndexedRootsCompleteForEvenParityShapeTheorem`, `combinedIndexedRootsCompleteForE8ShapeTheorem`, `enumerationIsComplete`, and the constructor payload. |
| Discrete Bianchi / GR non-flat | Started, not promoted. `DiscreteBianchiIdentitySurface` now has `finiteDifferenceDelta` over `GL.FactorVec`, proves `finiteDifferencesCommute` by `FVI.primeBumpCommutes`, exposes `AntisymmetrizedDoubleDifferenceZero`, and records `PrimeDifferenceToRiemannConnectionAdapterReceipt` as the exact adapter boundary. | Exact next blocker remains `missingPrimeDifferenceToRiemannConnectionAdapter`: `PrimeDifferenceToRiemannConnectionAdapterBundle` is named but not inhabited for any concrete non-flat target. After that come covariant divergence and contraction laws for contracted Bianchi. |
| Discrete Einstein tensor next thread | Indexed and non-promoting in `DASHI.Physics.Closure.DiscreteEinsteinTensorNextThreadIndex`. This follows the flat DET/CRT diagnostic, Schwarzschild candidate, continuum request, and W4 stress-energy interface. The next live thread is now recorded in `Docs/GRNonFlatNextThread.md`. | First kill condition is carrier-internal non-flat CRT/J connection or shift data. The full kill list remains discrete Riemann/curvature carrier, curvature-to-Ricci contraction, finite-r Bianchi witness, discrete Einstein tensor law, W4 matter/stress-energy interface receipt, `G_N`/weak-field diagnostic binding, metric error bound, connection error bound, Schwarzschild standard derivation, and continuum scaling theorem. |
| Schwarzschild / GR candidates | Request surface only. Flat finite-r/Minkowski and CRT diagnostics do not promote non-flat GR or Schwarzschild closure. | Exact first missing is `missingRadialValuation`; remaining primitives are `missingSphericalSymmetryPredicate`, `missingW4MassSource`, `missingBirkhoffCarrierProof`, `missingWeakFieldNewtonianPotential`, and `missingSchwarzschildMetricMatch`. No Birkhoff theorem, W4 source, weak-field limit, or metric-match theorem is constructed. |
| Continuum / realization-independent recovery | Theorem request only; W2-rate blocked and non-promoting. | Missing primitives are `missingLatticeEmbedding`, `missingContinuumFieldConvergence`, `missingMetricErrorBound`, `missingConnectionErrorBound`, `missingEinsteinTensorContinuity`, and `missingW2BridgeOrObstructionResolution`. W2 affects the rate surface, not a current existence theorem. |
| `W2/W3` authority | Request/obstruction-only. No token close marker found. The canonical definition sites now carry closure records proving the tokens remain constructorless, local record-constructor conversion is rejected, and no accepted non-postulated exact policy hook is present. `W2W3TokenProducingHooks` is wired to those definition-site audits. | `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken` and `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` remain constructorless. W2 first missing is a real constructor or accepted non-postulated exact policy hook for `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`; W2 payload fields remain after authority. W3 first missing is a real constructor, accepted-authority exact policy hook, or provider token inhabiting `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`. Local postulate-to-record rewrites and shadow records remain rejected closure routes. |

## Governance Audit 2026-05-14

Worker Governance audited the W2/W3/W4 authority surfaces only. The canonical
authority types remain empty datatypes:

- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`
- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.W3AcceptedEmpiricalAuthorityGate.W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`
- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.W4ZAdequacyReceipt.AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`

No accepted non-postulated exact policy hook was found in those canonical owner
modules. Existing hook-request and public-source evidence surfaces are
non-promoting request surfaces only. They explicitly record
`authorityTokenConstructedHere = false`, reject local shadow records, and reject
local postulate-to-record rewrites unless governance/owner approval adds a real
constructor or an exact token-producing hook at the canonical authority
boundary.

Therefore W2, W3, and W4 remain fail-closed. This audit changes no authority
type and constructs no token.

## Governance-Authority Worker Audit 2026-05-14

Worker Governance-Authority rechecked the canonical owner modules after the
latest worker round. No exact accepted authority value was found.

- W2 remains blocked by
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`, whose canonical definition is
  still `data NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken : Set where`.
- W3 remains blocked by `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, whose canonical
  definition is still `data W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken : Set where`.
- W4 remains blocked by `AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`, whose
  canonical definition is still
  `data AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority : Set where`.

The current hook/request surfaces remain non-promoting. They record evidence,
required signatures, and closure routes, but they also record that no accepted
non-postulated exact policy hook or provider token is present. No local shadow
record, postulated hook, or postulate-to-record rewrite is authorized by this
worker lane.

Exact remaining governance dependencies:

- W2: a real constructor or accepted non-postulated exact policy hook returning
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`.
- W3: a real constructor, accepted-authority exact policy hook, or provider
  token inhabiting `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`.
- W4: an exact provider/governance hook or owner-approved constructor
  inhabiting `AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`.

Discrete Einstein tensor indexing, Schwarzschild request surfaces, and continuum
request surfaces do not relax W4 or G6 gates. In particular,
`EinsteinEquationCandidate.W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt` is still
required before sourced GR language is admissible, and no G6 commutativity,
common-spine section, W4 adequacy, or W4/G6 closure should be inferred from
request-only modules.

## Paper-Readiness Roadmap 2026-05-15

This is a packaging guard, not a promotion. Paper readiness must be selected by
the strongest currently inhabited receipts, not by aspirational gate names.
Current inspection keeps W2/W3/W4 fail-closed because the canonical authority
token types remain constructorless and no accepted non-postulated exact hook is
present at the canonical sites:

- W2:
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken` is still absent at the
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation` boundary.
- W3:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` is still constructorless in
  `W3AcceptedEmpiricalAuthorityGate`.
- W4:
  `AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority` is still constructorless in
  `W4ZAdequacyReceipt`.

Paper 1 can be made paper-ready only as an internal/formal-methods result if
its claims avoid external authority language. The admissible positive Paper 1
surface now includes the official G6 tracked commuting theorem and above-
threshold tracked consumers, G2 direction-indexed SFGC schema extension
completion, and the G3 constructive finite-support route through certified
subtraction support. The package is:

- internal typed surfaces and diagnostics whose exact Agda receipts are already
  inhabited or explicitly request-only, including
  `G6OfficialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingTheorem` on the tracked route;
- fail-closed governance explaining why W2, W3, W4, W5, non-flat GR,
  Schwarzschild, continuum recovery, old full G6 `LaneOperator` promotion, and
  full unification are not claimed;
- a bounded validation appendix for the exact touched theorem/receipt surfaces,
  plus docs `git diff --check`;
- a clear external-authority appendix listing provider payloads still needed
  for W2, W3, W4/W5 DY convention, Candidate256 physical calibration, and W5 or
  GRQFT consumers.

Paper 1 is not ready if it needs any of these as positive claims: W2 natural
p2-convergence promotion, W3 accepted empirical authority, W4 Z adequacy,
Candidate256 physical calibration, W4 matter/stress-energy, a sourced discrete
Einstein equation, Schwarzschild recovery, continuum scaling, or limited/full
SM+GR/GRQFT unification.

Next-round queue for the shortest Paper 1 path:

1. Package G6 around `G6OfficialTrackedCrossLaneCommutingTheorem` and tracked
   above-threshold consumers, explicitly excluding old `LaneOperator` closure.
2. For G3, cite the certified subtraction support route, then leave valuation
   invariance, ultrametric, rescaling/min-shift, product support, and bracket
   support as explicit blockers.

## Current Tranche Note 2026-05-22

Gate 8 now has an explicit fail-closed composition surface in
`DASHI/Physics/Closure/CrossGateConsistency.agda`. The new record threads the
standalone exact-SM token, the Stone handoff receipt, the CKM exact witness
chain, and the Higgs dependency receipt, keeps `gate8Promotable = false`, and
records the open upstream blockers instead of inventing a new promotion layer.
The composition surface is typed and consumes the existing receipts only.
`DASHI/Physics/Closure/CrossGateCompositionTheorems.agda` now packages the
Gate 1/6 DHR-limit, Gate 5 Stone/GNS, and Gate 7 electroweak-mixing
composition receipts as a reusable fail-closed theorem layer.
The new Gate 7 bridge records keep `missingCarrierMixingTheorem` and the
electroweak adapter boundary open while making the exact upstream witnesses
first-class in the surface.
3. Keep E8 local semantic completeness as local-only until upstream supplies a
   constructor or promotion API for `E8RootEnumerationComplete`.
4. Keep GR non-flat out of Paper 1 unless explicitly scoped as future work; at
   most cite the adapter boundary until
   `PrimeDifferenceToRiemannConnectionAdapterBundle` is inhabited.
5. Preserve the W2/W3/W4/W5 external-authority appendix as fail-closed.

Full unification is a later gated state. Its prerequisite chain still includes:

- internal math: inhabit `PrimeDifferenceToRiemannConnectionAdapterBundle`,
  non-flat CRT/J connection or shift data, discrete
  Riemann/curvature, finite-r Bianchi, curvature-to-Ricci/scalar contraction,
  discrete Einstein tensor law, metric/connection error bounds, continuum
  convergence, old G6 `LaneOperator` migration or law split, G3 certified
  subtraction/product/bracket support, and upstream E8 promotion;
- governance/external authority: W2 promotion authority, W3 accepted evidence
  authority, W4/W5 accepted DY convention, W4 adequacy, Candidate256 physical
  calibration, W4 matter/stress-energy, W5/GRQFT promotion authority, and
  empirical validation receipts;
- GR non-flat specialization: W4 mass source, weak-field Newtonian-potential
  diagnostic binding, Birkhoff/spherical-symmetry route, Schwarzschild metric
  match, and continuum scaling theorem.

Therefore the current highest honest packaging target is a fail-closed Paper 1
with positive internal G2 schema, tracked-G6, and bounded constructive-G3
claims. Any limited SM+GR, GRQFT, sourced GR, physical calibration, or
full-unification claim still requires accepted external authority/token
payloads or exact non-postulated hooks plus bounded targeted validation.

## GR Next Live Thread

The user's proposed discrete Einstein tensor path is admissible only as a
request/diagnostic lane until exact receipts are imported and typechecked. The
next proof path is:

1. Construct carrier-internal non-flat CRT/J connection or shift data.
2. Define the discrete Riemann/curvature carrier from that connection.
3. Prove curvature symmetries and a finite-r Bianchi identity.
4. Add metric contraction from curvature to Ricci and scalar trace.
5. Define the discrete Einstein tensor `G_mu_nu = Ricci_mu_nu - 1/2 R g_mu_nu`.
6. Bind the sourced equation only after
   `EinsteinEquationCandidate.W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt` supplies
   `matterFieldFromW4` and `stressEnergyTensorFromW4`.
7. Treat `G_N` as a diagnostic/normalisation target until a weak-field
   Newtonian-potential law, physical-unit authority, and W4 mass-source receipt
   exist. No local numeric or dimensional convention may stand in for that
   receipt.
8. Add metric and connection error bounds, then a continuum scaling theorem.

Exact blockers are the current typed blockers: `missingCarrierInternalNonFlatConnectionFromCRT`,
`missingCurvatureToRicciContraction`, `missingFiniteRBianchiWitness`,
`missingDiscreteEinsteinTensorLaw`,
`missingW4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt`, `missingMetricErrorBound`,
`missingConnectionErrorBound`, `missingWeakFieldNewtonianPotential`,
`missingW4MassSource`, and `missingSchwarzschildMetricMatch`. These blockers
also keep the Schwarzschild and continuum lanes candidate/request-only.

## Validation Reminder

All Agda validation should be bounded. Use `timeout 30s`; do not run uncapped
Agda:

```bash
timeout 30s agda -i . PATH/TO/Module.agda
```

For docs-only synchronization, also run:

```bash
git diff --check -- Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md Docs/LimitedSMGRPaperReadinessMatrix.md Docs/Paper1InternalFormalMethodsOutline.md
```

Do not describe a gate as closed unless the exact theorem/receipt/token surface
has been inhabited and the relevant bounded validation command has passed.
