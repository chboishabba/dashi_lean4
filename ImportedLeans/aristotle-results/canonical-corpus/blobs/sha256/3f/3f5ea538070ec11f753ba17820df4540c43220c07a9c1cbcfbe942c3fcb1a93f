# Balaban propagator packet: coefficient-extraction ledger

Status: all six prerequisite papers are locally available and the targeted
operator extraction below is complete enough to begin the owned beta estimate.
This is a research ledger, not a theorem import and not evidence that the
deferred CMP 109 Theorem 2 has been proved.

## Literal source seam

CMP 109 uses the prerequisite results in its fluctuation analysis:

```text
regular gauge configuration + minimizer/background maps
  -> fluctuation Hessian and constrained Gaussian covariance
  -> E^(k+1) fluctuation effective action (2.13)
  -> second variation / vacuum polarization Pi^(j)
  -> beta_j = sum_x Pi^(j)_{mu nu}(x) x_mu x_nu, mu != nu  (5.42)
```

Literal anchors checked in the local text extraction:

- CMP 109 (2.13) defines the next fluctuation effective action as the logarithm
  of the constrained fluctuation integral; (2.15) performs inverse-square
  coupling renormalization.
- CMP 109 (5.37)--(5.38) decomposes the polarization tensor into the transverse
  Wilson-term coefficient plus a third-lattice-derivative remainder.  The
  following (5.42) identifies that coefficient with both the off-diagonal
  second momentum derivative and the coordinate-space moment used by the beta
  recurrence.  The text immediately after (5.42) explicitly warns that
  `beta_j`, while displayed as a function of `g_{j-1}`, depends on the prior
  coupling history as well.
- CMP 99 background-propagator Theorem 3.14 states the domain-sequence
  difference estimate, with the additional distance-decay factor (3.154).
  Its proof cancels random-walk terms localized in the common domain.
- CMP 102 Theorem 1 establishes the regular minimal orbit; Proposition 9 gives
  the analytic extension of `U_k(V)` and records derivative decay estimates
  for the regular background chart.

The remaining source facts needed for the first owned bridge are now also
literal rather than inferred:

- CMP 109 (4.35)--(4.37) replaces the local kernel by its free-boundary form,
  extends the admissible localization-domain sum, and defines
  `Pi_{mu nu}(x,y) = sum_{X in D_j} E^(2)_{mu nu}(X;x,y)`.  The beta tail must
  therefore control a resummed localization family, not merely finitely many
  diagram templates.
- CMP 109 (5.8)--(5.10) records translation symmetry, Ward identities and
  exponential position-space decay of `Pi`; (5.37)--(5.38) identifies the
  transverse coefficient and its third-derivative remainder.
- CMP 99 background-field Theorem 3.14 and (3.154) are the operator-level
  marked-difference input: random walks localizing in the common domain cancel
  and every survivor gains distance-to-discrepancy decay.
- CMP 116 supplies the separate resummation input: (1.26) bounds the
  localization-domain tree-length sum, (1.29) bounds the sum of terms with a
  fixed localization domain, and Lemma 3/(2.38) gives the exponentially small
  resummed activity.  These estimates must be applied after, not instead of,
  the CMP 99 marked comparison.

The normalization audit is mandatory: CMP 109 first displays `g_k^-2` terms
in the raw fluctuation integral, then rescales the fluctuation field before
introducing its Gaussian covariance. Background-propagator positivity must not
be misread as an automatic `exp(-c/g_k^2)` large-field estimate.

## Exact verified propagator input

In the locally available CMP 99 paper:

- Theorems 3.1–3.3 establish background-dependent propagator bounds and state
  constants independent of the domain sequence when the stated regularity
  hypotheses hold.
- Theorem 3.4 establishes analytic dependence on a complexified regular
  background-field neighborhood while preserving those estimates.
- Theorem 3.7 gives a convergent generalized random-walk representation;
  Corollary 3.8 localizes individual walk terms and retains exponential decay.

More specifically, its domain-sequence difference discussion culminates in
(3.154): random-walk contributions whose localizations remain in the common
domain cancel, while the remaining terms acquire an exponential factor in the
distance to the discrepancy.  This is the source input for the finite-volume
tail; the owned bridge is to propagate it through the polarization diagrams,
including the weighted `x_mu x_nu` moment and history/background sensitivity.

## Modern auxiliary method source (not a Yang--Mills substitute)

`Downloads/2403.09800.pdf`, Dybalski--Stottmeister--Tanimoto, *The Bałaban
variational problem in the non-linear sigma model* (2024), is useful as a
transparent proof template for the minimizer layer.  Its Sections 4.1--4.7
derive a constrained critical-point equation and solve it by Banach contraction;
Sections 4.2--4.6 and Appendix A obtain positivity and exponential kernel bounds
via random-walk expansions.

It is **not** an authority for the four-dimensional gauge covariance,
vacuum-polarization coefficient, history-dependent beta law, or CMP 109
Theorem 2.  Its value is methodological: once the six primary papers pin the
Yang--Mills operators, its contraction/Green-kernel proof layout is a candidate
for formalizing the background-minimizer sublemma without inventing an operator
normalization.

## Closed extraction boundary and next owned theorem

The prerequisite packet and the following literal anchors are now sufficient;
do not expand the ledger into a full reconstruction of all six papers before
attempting the beta estimate.

| Symbol | Definition source | Domain/codomain | Required uniform estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Q`, `Q_k` | CMP 98 | fine links to blocked links | norm/derivative and gauge covariance |
| `C`, `C*` | CMP 95/96 | constrained fluctuation coordinates | projection/constraint identities |
| `A^(k)` | CMP 109 plus packet | constrained Hessian | positivity and background stability |
| `C^(k)` | CMP 109 plus CMP 95/96/99 | covariance kernel | decay, derivatives, finite-volume comparison |
| `U_k(V)` | CMP 102 | coarse background to fine minimizer | existence, regularity, locality |
| `H_k` | CMP 99/102 | background variation map | decay and history sensitivity |
| `Pi^(j)` | CMP 109 §5 | bond/polarization kernel | Ward/transversality and local majorant |
| `beta_j` | CMP 109 (5.42) | coupling history to real | positive interval and sensitivity |

### Extracted operator anchors

- **Gauge-covariant block average.** CMP 98 (121)--(122) writes the nonlinear
  one-step average as `Q(V_0,A,c) = i log(...)` and proves its analytic split
  `Q(V_0,A,c) = L(Q(V_0)A)_c + C(V_0,A,c)`.  Proposition 3 then gives the
  analytic small-field control.  Equations (90)--(91) define the iterated
  averages.  This is the source-level `Q`, `Q_k` input; it is not an ordinary
  scalar block average.
- **Constrained covariance.** CMP 96 (2.156) gives the covariance in the
  form `C^(k) = C (C* A_k C)^(-1) C*` (with the paper's constrained-coordinate
  normalization).  The surrounding text states that the inverse inherits the
  required short-range properties.  Proposition 2.2 gives the generalized
  random-walk control, and Proposition 2.3 treats the corresponding averaged
  inverse.
- **Regular-background propagators.** CMP 99 background-field (3.25)--(3.26)
  defines the projected operator `R(U)` and the regularized Hessian
  `A'(U) = A''(U) + D*R(U)D + Q*(U)aQ(U)`.  Theorems 3.1--3.3 give the kernel
  estimates for `G'`, the averaged inverse, `R`, and `G`; Theorem 3.4 extends
  them analytically to the complex regular-background tube.  Theorem 3.7 is
  the localized random-walk expansion.
- **Minimizing background.** CMP 102 Theorem 1 provides the regular minimal
  orbit.  Proposition 9 identifies the analytic extension of the axial-gauge
  `U_k(V)` and gives its regular-background derivative bounds (via (190)).

The associated Agda surfaces are
[`BalabanCutoffBetaLaw.agda`](BalabanCutoffBetaLaw.agda),
[`BalabanVacuumPolarisationCoefficient.agda`](BalabanVacuumPolarisationCoefficient.agda),
and
[`BalabanVacuumPolarisationDomainTail.agda`](BalabanVacuumPolarisationDomainTail.agda).
The coupling law admits either direct finite-volume uniform beta bounds or a
reference-coefficient tail.  The domain-tail target is the source-faithful
inequality obtained by carrying CMP 99 (3.154) through CMP 109's weighted
polarization moment; it remains an unavailable owned theorem.  Its required
intermediate estimate is

```text
|E^(2)_Omega(X;x,y) - E^(2)_Omega'(X;x,y)|
  <= C exp(-delta_x |x-y|) exp(-kappa d(X))
       exp(-delta_0 discrepancyDistance(Omega,Omega';x,y)).
```

The resummation must retain the marked and tree-length costs jointly; it must
not take an infimum of the marked discrepancy distance over `X`, since a large
`X` can reach the discrepancy region while being suppressed by its tree length.
For near positions the required geometric charging inequality transfers either
the marked distance or the tree length into collar decay, leaving a summable
weakened tree weight.  For far positions ordinary spatial decay controls the
polynomial coordinate tail.  This yields the beta-tail certificate with any
chosen far rate strictly below half the spatial rate.
The canonical Agda theorem surface is now
`BalabanMarkedPolarisationResummation.betaDomainTail`; the older
`BalabanVacuumPolarisationDomainTail` name is only a fail-closed compatibility
boundary.  The theorem is constructed from a near marked-resummation bound and
a far spatial-moment bound.  The near bound remains the single owned analytic
input; it is not represented as a final-tail field.

### Literal marked-comparison entry point

CMP 109 (4.2)--(4.5) gives the factorwise starting point for the remaining
owned estimate.  Equation (4.3) expresses the derivatives entering
`E^(n)(X)` through derivatives of the background map `H_j`; the text following
it identifies those derivatives as sums of perturbative tree expressions with
exponential tree-length decay.  It also states that localizing one input outside
`X` supplies an additional factor controlled by its distance from `X`, yielding
(4.5).  For `n = 2`, (4.35) replaces the relevant `E^(2)(X)` expression by its
free-boundary form; (4.37) then resums it to the polarization tensor.

Thus the remaining proof is a finite telescoping replacement over the factors
in (4.3), with one marked CMP 99 domain-difference factor and all unchanged
factors controlled by the CMP 109 tree bounds.  The resummed `X`-sum is the
CMP 116 input.  This is the exact point where a new analytic inequality, rather
than another source wrapper, is required.

### Differentiated activity: no generic Cauchy detour

CMP 109 has already taken the two external variations before the relevant
localization/resummation step.  Equation (4.35) is explicitly the `n = 2`
case, and (4.37) defines

```text
Pi_{mu nu}(x,y) = sum_{X in D_j} E^(2)_{mu nu}(X;x,y).
```

Section 5 then derives exponential kernel decay directly from (4.37), in
(5.10), with a positive `delta_1` determined by the earlier localization
constants.  CMP 116 Lemma 3, (2.38), likewise gives a resummed activity bound
with a still-positive localization exponent after its decay split.

Consequently the next proof must bound the **already differentiated** marked
objects `E^(2)_Omega - E^(2)_Omega'`.  It must not introduce an unsourced
`|X|^2` derivative multiplicity or a generic Cauchy-radius loss.  Such an
argument is relevant only if the literal source estimate for `E^(2)` turns out
to be insufficient.  The active target is instead the marked analogue of the
existing CMP 109/CMP 116 differentiated resummation:

```text
sum_{X containing 0,x}
  |E^(2)_Omega(X;0,x) - E^(2)_Omega'(X;0,x)|
<= C exp(-delta_x |x|) exp(-delta_R R)       for |x| <= R/2.
```

The source-specific work is the factorwise CMP 99 replacement and the
marked-distance/large-localization charge.  Once that inequality is proved,
the canonical Agda theorem combines it with the elementary far moment bound
to construct the beta-domain tail.

### Decay-splitting source analogue

CMP 116 (1.31)--(1.32) supplies the exact form of the required bookkeeping
pattern.  Literally, its linear-size functions satisfy

```text
d_j(X) >= (L^j eta)^(-1) d_k(X_0),
```

and it converts the relevant pair of exponentials into

```text
exp (-(1 - delta) kappa d_k(Y) - delta kappa d_j(X)),
```

retaining a strictly positive residual `d_j(X)` exponent for the subsequent
`X`-sum.  The domain-tail proof needs the marked analogue

```text
delta_mark * markedDistance(X; 0, x)
  + kappa * treeLength(X)
  >= delta_collar * collarRadius
     + kappa' * treeLength(X),
```

for near `x`, with `kappa' > 0`.  It is now represented directly by
`markedDistanceOrLargeLocalisation` in the Agda comparison record.  CMP 116
shows the decay-splitting mechanism exists in the localized expansion, but
does **not** by itself identify its `X_0`/`Y` geometry with the marked CMP 99
domain discrepancy.  The missing owned lemma is precisely that identification:
an anchor/discrepancy localization map proving that a marked walk which does
not pay discrepancy distance necessarily forces a localization domain of the
required tree length.

### CMP 109 coefficient-collar dichotomy

CMP 109 already gives the raw geometric alternative needed for that map.  In
(3.5), for a coefficient cube `D`, it separates localization domains into

```text
X intersects the complement of D^2,    or    X is contained in D^2.
```

The discussion immediately following (3.5) states that the first class is
controlled in one of two ways: if it is separated from `D`, the derivative of
`H_j` pays exponential propagator decay; if it meets `D` while reaching outside
`D^2`, then `X` is large in the fine scale and the activity bound
`exp (-kappa d_j(X))` pays instead.  Equation (3.17) keeps both the activity
weight and the localized derivative factor, and the text explicitly says the
same bounds survive the later localization procedure.

For the domain-tail theorem, `D^2` must be chosen inside the common collar of
the two domain sequences.  The missing map is therefore no longer vague:
translate this CMP 109 `X outside D^2` dichotomy into the CMP 99 marked
random-walk discrepancy distance, then use the large-`X` alternative to supply
the residual tree-length charge in `markedDistanceOrLargeLocalisation`.

Connectedness supplies only the large-`X` branch.  Once all quantities have
been converted to the same block scale, a connected `X` joining an anchor cube
to a cube outside the chosen coefficient collar has
`d_j(X) >= c * collarRadius - C`; the constants absorb block diameters,
enlargements and the source metric.  This is enough to split
`exp (-kappa d_j(X))` into collar decay and a weaker summable tree weight.
It does **not** imply that `X` lying inside the collar gives equal terms: CMP
99 cancellation is for individual random-walk localizations lying in the
common region.  A nominally interior activity can still contain a surviving
walk, which must be charged by the marked CMP 99 distance factor.
