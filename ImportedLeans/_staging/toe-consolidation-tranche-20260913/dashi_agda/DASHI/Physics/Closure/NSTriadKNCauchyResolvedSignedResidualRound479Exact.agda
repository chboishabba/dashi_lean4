-- ROUND479 / DIRECT CAUCHY-RESOLVED BOUND FROM BASELINE + SIGNED RESIDUAL
--
-- R478 exposes the least-privilege terminal consumer directly:
--
--   Q_resolved(c) <= A * M(c).
--
-- The existing physical Cauchy tranche separately shows that the literal
-- completion splits into a diagonal part plus a signed off-diagonal part, and
-- that the diagonal part admits a cutoff-independent resolvent ceiling once a
-- physical rate floor is available.  R448 identifies the physical off-diagonal
-- scalar with the already-existing signed weighted flux.
--
-- This owner captures the exact algebraic producer shape needed to exploit that
-- fact without strengthening the consumer back to two helicity blocks.  A
-- producer may write
--
--   Q(c) = baseline * M(c) + residual(c)
--
-- and pay only
--
--   residual(c) <= slack * M(c),
--   baseline + slack = A.
--
-- The residual remains SIGNED.  No modulus, absolute Schur row sum, or
-- cardinality factor is introduced.  In the physical Cauchy realization the
-- intended residual is the off-diagonal weighted flux after the paid diagonal
-- contribution has been removed.
--
-- This file does not manufacture the physical residual estimate or the final
-- R447/R448/R451/R456 -> R478 same-object weld.
