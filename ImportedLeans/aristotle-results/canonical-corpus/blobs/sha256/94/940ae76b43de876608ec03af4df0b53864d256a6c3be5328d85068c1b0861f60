-- POAMS / QUANTUM MACHINES LAYERED RELEASE PROFILE
--
-- Primary NASA sources distinguish at least four states:
--   * a Space Act proprietary-period limitation on NASA continuation;
--   * a later public NASA technical memorandum;
--   * V5 data remaining in Quantum Machines possession;
--   * V5 hardware remaining in Quantum Machines possession.
-- This is therefore a genuine documented partial-release topology, not evidence
-- that all technical material crossed into the public domain.
