-- Corrected Kato/Hessian confinement diagnostic receipt.
--
-- This is a strict fail-closed receipt for the corrected sign convention at a
-- true λ2 minimum / vortex-core target: Hess(λ2) should be positive
-- semidefinite; positive ∂e1∂e2 λ2 is confinement evidence, not adverse
-- evidence.  The N=128 target record is purely symbolic/typed and is
-- empirical-only.  The receipt also keeps the diagonal identity, signed gap,
-- PSD minimum, gap-collapse, H5/H6, and Clay bridge blocker surfaces
-- explicit while remaining fail-closed.  The Kato-Morse program rows below
-- are corrected so CL2 is a trichotomy surface rather than a dichotomy
-- surface, CL1 remains open/fail-closed, CL1b remains open as a PDE-gap route,
-- CL1/CL1b now target ∂Ω_K / the boundary layer rather than interior Ω_K
-- localization, millerToH5 is closeable by standard interpolation but not yet
-- inhabited here,
-- and Calc E remains empirical-only.
