-- CHINESE STRATEGIC-SCIENTIST ROSTER SNOWBALL

-- The media roster is discovery-only.  Each technical-work identity is followed
-- outward into institutional/publication objects independently of the event
-- identity.  A media list cannot weld work, event, cause, or cross-national

-- repeatedly enumerated roster surfaced in Newsweek-derived and other reports
-- names nine people.  Cardinality and identity are therefore separate source
