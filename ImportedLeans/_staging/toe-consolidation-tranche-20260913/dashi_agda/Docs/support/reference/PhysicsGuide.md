# Physics Guide

Declared surface level: `packaging`, with theorem-owned canonical claim carriers.

This note is the shortest serious entry surface for an expert reader who wants
to know what the repo currently proves, what it only packages, where the
empirical lane sits, and what remains speculative.

If the question is "where is the simulator surface?", read
`SimulatorRoadmap.md` before this guide. The simulator roadmap explains the
unified parent/facade scaffold and the first bounded quantitative slice. This
physics guide then explains which physics claims are theorem-bearing,
bridge-only, empirical, or still speculative.

The current executable simulator slice is a stellar-composition proxy
diagnostic, not a promoted stellar model. Its Agda receipt records the missing
real-model authorities: carrier-derived matter/force law, EOS, opacity,
reaction network, hydrostatic solver, and empirical validation.
The route/lane joining plan is `UnifiedRoutesLanePlan.md`; it generalizes the
same fail-closed receipt pattern to Maxwell/gauge, Yang-Mills, Schrodinger,
GR, empirical, biology, runtime, arithmetic, and Gate 3 surfaces.

## Canonical Claim Owners

Read these code owners before treating this note as authoritative:

- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`
- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`
- `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`

Important correction:

- several recovery lanes are no longer "missing from zero"
- some are already theorem-bearing bridge surfaces in repo
- some have stronger archive-backed design language than the current repo docs admit
- none of that, by itself, upgrades the repo to solved unification
- several lanes are now best read as `advanced but blocked`, with named
  theorem-side blocker surfaces rather than generic missing steps

## Claim Levels

- `proved`: theorem-bearing Agda surfaces on the canonical proof spine.
- `bridge`: formal interfaces that transport established structure into a new
  vocabulary without yet yielding full downstream recovery.
- `packaging`: repo-facing records or instances that assemble already-existing
  carriers and witnesses without adding a new derivation theorem.
- `empirical`: measurement, normalization, validation, and report surfaces that
  are explicitly non-theorem and non-closure.
- `speculative`: intended physics interpretations or future recovery programs
  that are not currently established by the canonical spine.

## One-Paragraph Reading

The current repo claim is not "physics is solved." The canonical theorem route
 establishes a contraction-to-quadratic-to-signature-to-Clifford-to-full-closure
 stack on the current shift-side carrier, with known-limits GR/QFT bridge notes
 layered after that. The strongest present formal achievement is the closure
 spine itself, especially the strengthened contraction-to-quadratic seam and
 the canonical 4D-signature route. The current unifying interfaces
 (`DashiDynamics`, gradient-flow, Hamilton-Jacobi, Schrodinger-facing gaps)
 are real and useful, but they are packaging/bridge surfaces over bounded
 carriers, not a proof of full physical unification.

The repo also now has adjacent archive-derived lanes that matter for how a
serious reader interprets the broader DASHI program: a local DNA-first Agda
lane under `Ontology/DNA/`, plus brain-side and brain-DNA/channel crossover
material that is still mostly archive-backed or sibling-repo adjacent. Those
lanes are now shown on `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, but they are not to
be read as current theorem evidence for physics closure.

There is now also a named core-spine bridge:
[`CoreSpineBridge.md`](CoreSpineBridge.md). It makes explicit the typed chain
from `Base369.TriTruth` to `DASHI.Algebra.Trit`, then to
`RealTernaryCarrier.Carrier n`, `AgreementUltrametric.ultrametricVec`, the
bounded contraction-certificate interface, and the CRT/J p47/p59/p71 scalar
bridge. This is a real bridge layer, not a replacement for the canonical
closure spine and not a proof of full physical or biological recovery.
The companion reviewer inventory
[`CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md`](CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md) records
which formalism claims are theorem-backed and which remain obligations.
The origin/disconnection governance surface is
[`OriginTraceabilityLedger.md`](OriginTraceabilityLedger.md). It reconciles the
downloaded traceability diagnosis against current repo state and fixes the
safe reading: the origin thesis is a bridge/governance spine until a concrete
theorem surface names its carrier, map, certificate, and consumer.

## Staged Reading Ladder

1. Start with [SimulatorRoadmap.md](SimulatorRoadmap.md).
   This fixes what "simulator" means: a receipt-gated scaffold, not a finished
   all-scale prediction engine.
2. Read [UnifiedMathLanguageSpine.md](UnifiedMathLanguageSpine.md).
   This is the common carrier grammar used by the simulator facade.
3. Read [CanonicalProofSpine.md](CanonicalProofSpine.md).
   This is the canonical theorem route and naming standard.
4. Read [ClosureContractStatus.md](ClosureContractStatus.md).
   This fixes what the downstream chain actually consumes today.
5. Read [MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md](MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md).
   This is the best compact statement of what counts as the current milestone.
6. Read [CoreSpineBridge.md](CoreSpineBridge.md).
   This is the compact map from `Base369` / `LogicTlurey` / CRT/J surfaces into
   the current ternary physics carrier and agreement ultrametric.
7. Read [CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md](CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md).
   This is the reviewer-facing theorem/gap inventory for the six core-spine
   formalisms.
8. Read [OriginTraceabilityLedger.md](OriginTraceabilityLedger.md).
   This reconciles origin-traceability claims with local repo truth and records
   the promotion gates for empirical adequacy, dynamics, and atom/chemistry.
9. Read [AntifascisticBoundaryAndMusic.md](AntifascisticBoundaryAndMusic.md).
   This records the safe antifascistic/three-body/music boundary examples and
   keeps them out of the canonical proof spine.
10. Read [MusicalAttractorTheorem.md](MusicalAttractorTheorem.md).
   This names the exploratory music bridge target over `(Z/12Z)^n` without
   promoting it into a physics-closure theorem.
11. Read [NaturalDynamicsLaw.md](NaturalDynamicsLaw.md).
   This explains why the present dynamics-facing story is still too engineered
   to call a natural physical law.
12. Read [PhotonuclearEmpiricalRegistry.md](PhotonuclearEmpiricalRegistry.md).
   This isolates the empirical lane and its non-claim boundary.
13. Read [PhysicsArchiveCoverageMap.md](PhysicsArchiveCoverageMap.md).
   This shows which archived threads actually reduce current theorem risk.
14. Read `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.svg`.
   This is the plain-language map from repo surfaces to familiar physics.
15. Read `Docs/PhysicsRecoveryLedger.md` and `Docs/ArchiveRecoveryCrosswalk.md`.
   These settle which recovery lanes are repo-native, archive-backed, or still open.
16. Read `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.svg`.
   This now includes the adjacent DNA / brain / crossover lanes and marks them
   explicitly as adjacent rather than theorem-closing.
17. Read `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`,
   `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`, and
   `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`.
   These are the current theorem-owner claim surfaces.
18. Read [Docs/AtomAndWaveRecoveryStatus.md](AtomAndWaveRecoveryStatus.md).
   This is the canonical public status surface for shell/orbit/profile and
   wave/regime progress, plus the remaining chemistry/quantum gap.

## Canonical Theorem Route

The canonical spine is:

1. `DASHI.Physics.ConcreteClosureStack`
2. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`
3. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`
4. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
5. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
6. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsClosureFullInstance`
7. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosureShiftInstance`
8. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.KnownLimitsGRBridgeTheorem`
9. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`

Status by level:

- `proved`: steps 2 through 7 on the current canonical path.
- `bridge`: steps 3, 4, 8, and 9 in the sense that they reinterpret or expose
  structure across physical vocabularies.
- `bridge/unified-owner`: `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`
  packages the strongest current repo-native unification claim.
- `bridge/adapter`: `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`
  exposes the seam between abstract unification and the canonical package.
- `packaging/atom-chemistry`: `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`
  packages the strongest current atom/chemistry interpretation layer while
  keeping explicit remaining gates.
- `speculative`: treating steps 8 and 9 as full GR/QFT recovery rather than
  known-limits bridge surfaces.

## Current Bottleneck

The main bottleneck is still the same one recorded across the repo docs:

- prove the invariant quadratic and uniqueness-up-to-scale seams cleanly enough
  that the downstream signature, Clifford, gauge, and wider physical-language
  claims become less interface-driven and more theorem-driven;
- derive a natural dynamics law rather than reusing engineered or local shift
  witnesses;
- widen from the current bounded carrier to a more realization-independent
  physical story without silently upgrading packaging into proof.

In repo terms, the strongest theorem pressure remains on the
contraction/projection/delta/Lorentz side, not on additional high-level
analogy language.

## Current Lane State

- `natural/conserved`: advanced to a schedule-independent coarse law, then
  blocked on a named next ingredient rather than widened by rhetoric.
- `continuum/adapter`: advanced to a canonical/noncanonical coarse recovery
  identification with fieldwise seam equalities, then blocked on richer
  MDL-side obligations.
- `gauge/GR-QFT`: advanced to an interpretable observable payload that now
  reaches the bridge owners and a downstream consumer, but stronger recovery is
  blocked on upstream lanes.
- `atomic/nuclear`: advanced through shell/dictionary recovery, photonuclear
  contact, and chemistry-right-limits gates, but blocked on interpretation
  contract + atomic owner-cycle cleanup before any spectra/scale-setting move.

## Strongest Evidence

- `proved`: the current closure stack is real, typed, and canonical rather
  than a loose proposal. The repo has an explicit theorem route to a full
  closure instance and a minimal-credible shift instance.
- `proved`: the strong contraction-to-quadratic layer now carries explicit seam
  witnesses, and the downstream chain currently needs only the
  normalized-quadratic contract.
- `bridge`: realization-independence is no longer merely aspirational; the repo
  already has a narrow theorem surface contrasting the canonical shift witness
  with an independent B4-backed witness.
- `bridge`: the repo now has disciplined interface layers for variational,
  gradient-flow, and wave-facing consumers over `DashiDynamics`.
- `bridge`: the repo already has a theorem-bearing known-limits wave ladder
  with recovered wavefront, wave geometry, wave regime, wave observables, and
  canonical consumers.
- `bridge`: the repo now has theorem-bearing abstract records for natural
  dynamics, conserved observables, continuum witness, observable transport, and
  gauge/matter recovery in the abstract bundle layer.
- `packaging/atom-quantum`: the atom/quantum side is stronger than generic packaging alone;
  the repo already has shell/orbit/profile computation, signature/profile
  locking, synthetic realization witnesses, and an archive-backed closed-shell
  dictionary layer, even though atomic recovery itself is still open.
- `bridge`: the known-limits side is stronger than "notation only"; the repo
  carries theorem-backed `grLike` and `qftLike` status in the known-limits
  sense, while still not justifying full GR/QFT recovery claims.
- `bridge`: the core-spine carrier bridge is now explicit. `TritTriTruthBridge`,
  `TritCarrierBridge`, `FascisticContractionInstance`, `StageQuotient`,
  `MoonshineBridge`, and `CRTPeriodJFixedBridge` connect the triadic algebra,
  ternary carrier, agreement ultrametric, contraction-certificate surface, and
  p47/p59/p71 CRT/J scalar channel.
- `empirical`: the photonuclear lane is now normalized, versioned, and
  explicitly marked as empirical-only rather than being mixed into theorem
  claims.
- `speculative`: physical realization, continuum scaling, full gauge/matter
  recovery, and realization-independent closure remain open.

## Non-Claims

- This repo does not currently prove full GR recovery, even though the
  known-limits GR lane is theorem-backed.
- It does not currently prove full QFT recovery, even though the known-limits
  QFT lane is theorem-backed.
- It does not currently prove atomic spectra, bonding, chemistry, or a
  textbook Schrödinger law, even though shell/profile and wave/regime
  scaffolds are real and substantial.
- It does not currently derive a natural physical dynamics law from first
  principles on the general carrier.
- It does not currently prove realization-independent closure.
- It does not currently prove gauge/matter recovery as a finished theorem.
- It does not currently justify reading packaging surfaces as a unified theory
  of physics.
