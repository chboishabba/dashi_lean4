  cooperClassifiedNSWAsSettledWithoutSettledLaw privyCouncilHolding
  "Cooper v Stuart [1889] UKPC 16, paras 11-13"
  "The Privy Council classified New South Wales as practically unoccupied, without settled inhabitants or settled law, and placed it in the settled-colony category."

cooperReceptionReceipt = primaryReceipt
  cooperUsedClassificationToReceiveEnglishLaw privyCouncilHolding
  "Cooper v Stuart [1889] UKPC 16, paras 11-13"
  "The settled-colony classification was used to determine that applicable English law prevailed in the colony and governed land transactions; this is an operational legal consequence of the classification."

maboRejectionReceipt : PrimaryReceipt
maboRejectionReceipt = primaryReceipt
  maboRejectedEnlargedTerraNulliusForNativeTitle highCourtHolding
  "Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23"
  "The High Court rejected the enlarged terra-nullius assumptions that had denied recognition of pre-existing Indigenous land rights under traditional law and custom."

maboPreExistingReceipt : PrimaryReceipt
maboPreExistingReceipt = primaryReceipt
  maboRecognisedPreExistingNativeTitleRatherThanCreatingIt highCourtHolding
  "Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23; later High Court statement in Yorta Yorta litigation"
  "Native title is treated as arising from pre-existing traditional law/custom and recognised by common law rather than created ex nihilo by Crown recognition."

  uluruStatesSovereigntyNeverCeded firstNationsPoliticalStatement
  "Uluru Statement from the Heart, 2017"
  "The Statement says First Nations sovereignty has never been ceded or extinguished and co-exists with Crown sovereignty; this is not attributed to the High Court."

loveConnectionReceipt : PrimaryReceipt
loveConnectionReceipt = primaryReceipt
  loveRecognisesDistinctConstitutionalConnectionToCountry highCourtCurrentDoctrine
  "Love v Commonwealth; Thoms v Commonwealth [2020] HCA 3"
  "The High Court majority held Aboriginal Australians within the relevant test are beyond the aliens power, relying on a special cultural, historical and spiritual connection with Australian territory recognised by common law."

  classificationOperationallyChangedAvailableLegalConsequences dashiSynthesis
  "DASHI synthesis over Cooper, Mabo and Love"
  "The legal category assigned to Indigenous people/Country altered which law, land relations and state powers the colonial/constitutional legal system treated as available; this is a DASHI synthesis from primary holdings, not a quotation from any one court."

  semanticReclassificationWasNecessaryToSettledColonyReceptionLogic dashiSynthesis
  "DASHI synthesis over Cooper v Stuart [1889] UKPC 16 paras 11-13 and Mabo [1992] HCA 23"
  "Within the settled-colony reception logic actually articulated in Cooper, classifying NSW as lacking settled inhabitants/law was not incidental description: it was a premise used to determine reception of English law. This does not establish every colonial actor's subjective motive."
