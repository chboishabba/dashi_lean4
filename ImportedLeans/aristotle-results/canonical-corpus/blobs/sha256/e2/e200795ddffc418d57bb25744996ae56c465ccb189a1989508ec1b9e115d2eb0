-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Make the remaining Com theorem an operator-realisation problem rather than
-- another shell-arithmetic problem.  A pair product is represented by three
-- nonnegative factors: a left contraction, the cross-fibre overlap, and a
-- right contraction.  If both outer factors are <= 1, the pair product is
-- bounded by the overlap.  Therefore any overlap satisfying the already
-- proved Round-34 half-dyadic envelope gives the required pair-product decay.
--
-- The repository's actual centered (L6,L3) scale calculation is then inserted
-- as a concrete overlap candidate: its two squared Taylor branches obey
--
--   overlap_d <= (1/2) 2^-d.
--
-- Hence the abstract Gram reduction is immediately inhabited by real existing
-- NS arithmetic.  What remains physical is to identify the literal
-- T_q^* T_r and T_q T_r^* norms with such factorized cells.  No operator norm
-- is manufactured here.
