# The cuisine lane

Root module of the `Cuisine` library: a Lean formalisation of the proof-relevant
content of the Agda cuisine corpus at `Agda/DASHI/Culture/Cuisine/`, together
with the theorems that corpus states informally, checks at single points, or
leaves open.

Layers, in dependency order:

* `Cuisine.SensoryCore` — the stimulus/reading carriers, the umami interaction
  law with its closed form and non-additivity, and the observer- and
  process-dependence obstructions;
* `Cuisine.Surfaces` — the surface non-collapse ledger, its soundness, its
  directedness and its incompleteness;
* `Cuisine.Lineage` — the sauce derivation graph as an acyclic partial order,
  and the carbonara identity envelope as a partition;
* `Cuisine.ProcessRoute` — the phantom-index defect in the supplied mole route
  relation, and a repaired route family for which order-sensitivity is a
  theorem;
* `Cuisine.DataFlow` — the promotion pipeline and its fail-closed property;
* `Cuisine.Publication` — the publication decision map, the hole in the supplied
  impact assessment, and the repaired assessment;
* `Cuisine.Provenance` — channel-dependent provenance routing;
* `Cuisine.LedgerPattern` — what the corpus-wide `Bool`-with-`= false` field
  pattern does and does not prove;
* `Cuisine.CarryingCapacity` — the free-`standing` hole in the supplied
  carrying-capacity record, its total repair, and a fail-closed variant for
  partial measurement;
* `Cuisine.SourceAtlas` — the twenty-two-source receipt, with distinctness;
* `Cuisine.HyperfabricGuard` — the lane's one cross-domain definitional import,
  audited: a guard that really does reject every promotion route, a vocabulary
  separated only by naming, a contentless cuisine-side facet, and a cardinality
  obstruction to reading the triad surfaces as ternary;
* `Cuisine.ToneSeparation` — the honest bridge to `Synthesis.ToneCore`: the
  carriers are abstractly isomorphic, the structures are not;
* `Cuisine.Witnesses` — the finite witnesses and the Agda regression suite;
* `Cuisine.EndToEnd` — the `CuisineSpine` interface, its canonical inhabitant,
  and the composite theorem `cuisine_end_to_end`;
* `Cuisine.AxiomAudit` — prints the axiom dependencies of the headline results.

See `CUISINE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md` for the provenance map, the classification of
the Agda material, and the list of remaining proof obligations.
