-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Round 41 reduced the physical Com theorem to one cross-channel Gram face,
-- but the provisional same-object route still asked for the exact equality
--
--   physical pair product = six-three Gram pair product.
--
-- The attached analysis suggested a sharper route: use shell-support
-- intersection before norm estimation.  This file proves that exact equality
-- is stronger than necessary.
--
-- Let m(q,r) be a nonnegative support-overlap multiplicity with m<=1.  If the
-- literal one-channel physical pair product obeys
--
--   P(q,r) <= m(q,r) * g(|q-r|),
--
-- where g is the already-certified centered (L6,L3) two-branch squared gap,
-- then automatically
--
--   P(q,r) <= g(|q-r|) <= (1/2) 2^{-|q-r|}.
--
-- We construct an actual Round-35 `GramInterferenceCell` whose pairProduct is
-- the literal physical P(q,r), whose overlap is g, and whose outer factors are
-- exactly one.  Therefore the Round-40 single-channel realization follows
-- without identifying P itself with the model Gram value.
--
-- A Bool support graph is supplied as the canonical 0/1 specialization.  The
-- remaining physical Com theorem is now the concrete support/product bound on
-- U_q^* U_r (plus the already-proved adjoint-face equality), not an artificial
-- exact numerical equality with the six-three candidate.
