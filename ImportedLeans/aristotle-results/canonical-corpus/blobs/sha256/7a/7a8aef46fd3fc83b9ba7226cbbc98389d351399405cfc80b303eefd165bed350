module DASHI.Physics.Closure.NSTriadKNPhysicalHardHighTriadSelectionExact where

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PURPOSE
-- Select the exact physical triads contributing to the repository's hard
-- high-output Fourier projection.  The low region at shell cutoff p is the
-- squared-radius ball
--
--   |k|^2 < 4^(p+1),
--
-- and the high region is its Boolean complement.  Filtering the already exact
-- cutoff-cube triad enumeration preserves soundness, completeness and
-- duplicate freedom.  This is an exact theorem for the hard projector; a
-- separate finite-band comparison is still required for Luo's smooth
-- Littlewood--Paley projector convention.
