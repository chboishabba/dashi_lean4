-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Put raw localization and the two-source multiplier Green contraction into
-- one nonempty-subset basis.  The public sign is the Round-40 canonical sign
--
--   projected spillover
--     = sum_S raw_S - sum_(S,T) green_(S,T).
--
-- Each Green pair owns an orbit tag, orientation tag and collar displacement.
-- Signed contributions are aggregated by owner before any upper bound is
-- applied.  The exact-cancellation fibre is then removed definitionally and
-- only the four surviving owner totals are taxed against 55/18874368.
