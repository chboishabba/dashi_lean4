-- DASHI CONTRIBUTION
--
-- Keep the derivative of printed equation (0.12) as a provenance-bearing
-- chain-rule DAG until the final flattening step.  The four leaves are
--
--   D M_source, D U_cross, D M_target^{-1}, D U_c^{-1};
--
-- they feed D RelativeProduct, then D log, D Avg, D exp and finally the
-- left multiplication by U_c.  Every edge below carries an equality between
-- the semantic derivative node and the value computed from its immediate
-- parents.  Consequently the flattened derivative cannot silently swap in a
-- separately bounded matrix.
--
-- Norm/mass estimates remain consumers of these exact nodes.  This separation
-- is deliberate: semantic chain-rule identity is proved before Schur/Frobenius
-- projection, exactly as required by the Gate-I same-object audit.
