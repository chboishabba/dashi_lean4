# Brain Physics Boundary Handles

Non-promoting boundary inventory for the current Brain -> BrainDNA -> chemistry/physics-facing handoff lane.

This document is an inventory, not a promotion receipt. It records the exact local names that currently expose Brain connector coordinates or handles, and it states the physics laws that are still absent from this boundary.

## Scope

- Worker role: bounded read-and-document inventory.
- Owned artifact: `Docs/BrainPhysicsBoundaryHandles.md`.
- Searched surfaces: `Ontology/Brain`, `Ontology/BrainDNA`, `DASHI`, and existing Brain docs for `BrainConnector`, `hamiltonian`, `crossBand`, `thermoChecksum`, and `BrainPhysicsHandoffPromotion`.
- Worktree note: the repo already had unrelated dirty changes before this document was added. This inventory does not revert or overwrite them.

## Local Brain Connector Handles

### Region, motif, and lens coordinates

`Ontology/Brain/BrainRegionAutomatonSurface.agda` defines the local region vocabulary:

- `BrainRegion`: `S3`, `S4`, `mu`
- `RegionLens`: `s3Lens`, `s4Lens`, `muLens`
- `RegionMotif`: `M1` through `M9`
- `motifIndex : RegionMotif -> Nat`
- `lensOf : BrainRegion -> RegionLens`
- `motifOf : BrainRegion -> RegionMotif`
- `RegionCorrespondence` with fields `region`, `lens`, and `motif`
- exact witnesses `correspondence-lens-exact`, `correspondence-motif-exact`, and `observeRegionState-motif`

This is a typed coordinate handle for region/lens/motif packaging. It is not a neural dynamics law.

### Brain theme and coherence profiles

Local Brain theme/profile surfaces exist as theorem-thin packaging:

- `Ontology/Brain/BrainLearningEigenbasisSurface.agda`: `BrainLearningEigenbasisProfile`, `profileOfState`, `profile-threshold-exact`, `profile-phase-exact`, `profile-width-exact`, and `profile-stateOf-width-layer-coherent`.
- `Ontology/Brain/BrainMorphospaceGapJunctionSurface.agda`: a morphospace/gap-junction surface with a `coherence : MorphospacePoint -> MorphospacePoint -> Nat` field.
- `Ontology/Brain/BrainThemeConsumerLaws.agda`: `BrainThemeConsumer` includes `coherenceWithSelf`, with `consumer-self-coherence-exact`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainThemeIntegratedSemantics.agda`: `BrainThemeIntegratedSemanticProfile` carries `lens`, `motif`, `visualClass`, `learningPhase`, `morphSemantic`, `order`, `width`, `emittedAdmissibility`, `recoveryBoundary`, `thermoChecksum`, `hamiltonianChecksum`, and `crossBand`.

These profiles expose exact alignment and checksum handles. They do not assert neuroscience completeness, learning dynamics, or physical law recovery.

### fMRI observation quotient handle

`DASHI/Physics/Closure/BrainConnectomeFMRIObservationQuotient.agda` records a
non-promoting empirical observation target for the perception lane:

`phase orbit class -> neural state initialization -> connectome-constrained
processing -> high-resolution/laminar fMRI readout -> behavioral report`.

The module names the DASHI brain object `B = (C, N, P, O)` where `C` is a
structural connectome, `N` is neural or microcircuit state, `P` is processing
transition, and `O` is observed readout. It treats high-resolution/laminar fMRI
as a macroscopic observation quotient for layer profile, column pattern,
orientation map, retinotopic geometry, and temporal coherence. It does not
claim a BOLD model, fMRI calibration, behavioral adequacy, or perception
closure.

The current typed target includes a formal connectome carrier
`C = (V,E,W,Lambda)`, ternary state carrier `sigma : V -> {-1,0,+1}`,
connectome-constrained threshold transition, MDL processing energy, connectome
symmetry quotient, processing orbit quotient, inverse-observation target, and
laminar readout factorization constraint. These are bridge handles only; no
dataset-specific transition, hemodynamic transfer function, layer-calibrated
BOLD model, or behavioral adequacy receipt is present.

The bridge also names formal proof obligations rather than only prose: a
pointwise ternary gate law, an accepted complexity order for `delta_C`, MDL
descent soundness, quotient equivalence laws, class-of-state projection, and
symmetry-respecting bridge/readout laws. These obligations are not dataset
receipts and do not establish empirical adequacy.

### Developmental genomic inverse handle

`DASHI/Physics/Closure/DevelopmentalGenomicInverseBridge.agda` records the
developmental bridge that sits below the connectome/fMRI observation handle.
The forward chain is:

`genome -> regulatory activation -> morphogenesis -> neural differentiation ->
developmental connectome -> mature processing -> neuronal state -> observable
readout`.

The inverse chain is:

`phenotype/brain residual -> observation residual -> processing residual ->
connectome residual -> morphogenesis residual -> regulatory residual ->
candidate genomic perturbation`.

This is a boundary handle for inverse search. It states that observed
conditions can constrain a candidate regulatory fibre and candidate genomic
perturbations through phenotype residual, MDL perturbation, pleiotropy, and
layer-constraint penalties. It does not claim DNA encodes a brain snapshot,
thoughts, percepts, or a disease label; it also does not validate any specific
gene, regulatory element, developmental law, connectome formation model, or
biological/cognitive closure.

The same module also records a synthetic construct calibration handle:
`SyntheticConstructCarrier`, `SyntheticBiologyInverse`, GFP/RFP reporter
fixtures, metabolic-odor target, and short-vs-long pathway counterfixtures.
These are engineered search/calibration targets only. They do not provide
construct-library authority, wet-lab validation, host-safety validation,
CRISPR-guide authority, metabolic-engineering proof, or transfer of synthetic
fixture performance to natural genetics.

### Cross-band and Hamiltonian-like handles

The current BrainDNA connector chain exposes `crossBand` and `hamiltonian` as `Nat` fields carried through exact profile witnesses:

- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainExtractionConnectorDepth.agda`: `BrainExtractionConnectorDepth` has `crossBand : Nat` and `hamiltonian : Nat`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainSummaryStructuralDepth.agda`: `BrainSummaryStructuralDepth` has `crossBand : Nat` and `hamiltonian : Nat`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainCrossoverAbstractComposition.agda`: `BrainCrossoverAbstractProfile` has `crossBand : Nat` and `hamiltonian : Nat`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainAtomicChemistryHandoff.agda`: `BrainAtomicChemistryHandoffProfile` has `sheet : SheetCoordinates n`, `crossBand : Nat`, `hamiltonian : Nat`, and `recoveryBoundary : Nat`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainConnectorSemanticDepth.agda`: `BrainConnectorSemanticDepthProfile` has `crossBand : Nat` and `hamiltonian : Nat`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainConnectorEndToEndSemanticDepth.agda`: `BrainConnectorEndToEndSemanticProfile` has `crossBand : Nat` and `hamiltonian : Nat`.
- `Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainConnectorEndToEndSemanticLaws.agda`, `BrainConnectorConsumerSemantics.agda`, `BrainConnectorConsumerLaws.agda`, `BrainConnectorIntegratedConsumerSemantics.agda`, and `BrainConnectorIntegratedConsumerLaws.agda` carry `thermoChecksum`, `hamiltonian`, and `crossBand` through downstream consumer/law profiles.

Important boundary: the local field name `hamiltonian` is a checksum/summary-style natural-number handle in this lane. It is not a Hamiltonian dynamics theorem.

### Thermo and Hamiltonian checksums

`Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainChemistryCodecConsumer.agda` defines `BrainChemistryCodecConsumerProfile` with:

- `thermoChecksum : Nat`
- `hamiltonianChecksum : Nat`
- canonical witnesses `consumerThermoChecksumCanonical` and `consumerHamiltonianChecksumCanonical`

`Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainWholeChainIntegrationLaw.agda` defines:

- `SemanticChecksumPair` with fields `thermo : Nat` and `hamiltonian : Nat`
- `chainCarrierChecksum`
- `composeHopChecksums`
- `wholeChainSemanticChecksumComposes`
- `wholeChainChecksumMatchesStreamingCarrier`

This is a checksum-composition handle across the current chain, not a thermodynamic law or Hamiltonian evolution law.

### Physics-facing handoff handle

`Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainAtomicChemistryHandoff.agda` is the local interface-like handoff. It imports `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` and packages:

- `BrainAtomicChemistryHandoffProfile`
- `physicsRecovery : AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`
- `chemistryCarrierSupport : Set`
- exact witnesses including `handoffChemistryStructured`, `handoffCrossBandMatchesIntegration`, `handoffHamiltonianMatchesIntegration`, and `handoffRecoveryBoundaryExact`

The module comment states that it remains theorem-thin and does not claim atomic recovery, chemistry recovery, or a physical derivation.

`Ontology/BrainDNA/BrainPhysicsHandoffPromotion.agda` exists, but its local boundary is explicitly gated:

- `H_phys` maps the existing `C_atom` carrier to `O_chem`.
- `BrainPhysicsHandoffPromotion` composes `Whole.I_chain` through `H_phys`.
- It carries `Candidate256.canonicalCandidate256QuotientCrossBandLaw`, `LchemWitness`, and `AtomicChemistryRecoveryGateWitness`.
- Its `nonClaimBoundary` strings state that it does not reinterpret the BrainDNA carrier and that atomic recovery gates are exposed only as gates already present on `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`.

Despite the filename, this inventory does not treat that file as a Brain-to-physics law receipt. It is a gated composition surface over already-landed chemistry/closure gates.

## Missing Physics Laws

No local Brain boundary theorem receipt was found that proves any of the following from the Brain connector handles:

- Hamiltonian dynamics.
- Maxwell equations.
- Schrodinger equation or continuum Schrodinger dynamics.
- General-relativistic curvature or sourced Einstein equations.
- Full Standard Model recovery.
- Full SM+GR unification or physics unification.

The repo contains physics modules and downstream closure surfaces elsewhere, including Schrodinger/Einstein/SM/GRQFT-named files, but the Brain boundary files inspected here only carry theorem-thin exactness, checksum, cross-band, recovery-boundary, and handoff gates. Existing claim-boundary docs also mark limited SM+GR/GRQFT promotion as downstream and not complete.

## Required For Future Lateral-Support Review

A future lateral-support review would need receipts beyond this inventory:

1. A theorem that maps the Brain connector coordinates into a declared physics state space with explicit units, parameters, and invariants.
2. A real dynamics law over the `hamiltonian` handle, not just a `Nat` checksum or profile field.
3. A bridge showing how `crossBand` participates in a physical interaction or observable law, with exact hypotheses and nontrivial consequences.
4. A thermodynamic interpretation of `thermoChecksum` with state variables, conservation/dissipation conditions, and calibration status.
5. External calibration or authority receipts if empirical adequacy is claimed.
6. For Maxwell, Schrodinger, GR curvature, Standard Model, or unification language: a theorem receipt that consumes this Brain boundary and proves the named law under stated assumptions.
7. An explicit non-claim ledger for anything still only carried as a gate, candidate, checksum, or diagnostic.

Until those receipts exist, the correct reading is: non-promoting Brain-to-physics boundary handles are present; Brain-derived physics laws are missing.
