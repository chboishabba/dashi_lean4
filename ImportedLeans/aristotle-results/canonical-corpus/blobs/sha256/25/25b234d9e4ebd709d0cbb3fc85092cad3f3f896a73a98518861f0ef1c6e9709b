# Autonomous Orchestrator Closure Frame

Applied skills:

- `get-shit-done`
- `autonomous-orchestrator`

## Superseding State

As of `2026-05-03`, the closure checklist referenced below is complete as a
historical acceptance/provenance surface. The active routing source is now the
`TODO.md` Active Blocker Board plus `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`.

Orchestrator runs should route to TODO active blockers, not to
`Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md` as an unfinished checklist.
Workers must not reopen completed checklist items unless an active blocker
explicitly names that module as its bounded file surface.

## ZKP Frame

O:
- Human/operator: repo owner and reviewer
- Agent surfaces: Codex planner/executor plus the Python-backed autonomous
  orchestrator
- Repo: `dashi_agda`
- Canonical execution/control documents:
  `spec.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`,
  `devlog.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
- Main execution surfaces:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`,
  canonical closure modules under `DASHI/Physics/Closure/`,
  and repo-facing export surfaces `CanonicalStageC`, `AxiomSet`, `Everything`

R:
- The repo must complete the remaining physics-closure spine work without
  drifting back into setup churn.
- The orchestrator must route from durable repo state toward the remaining
  theorem work, not toward already-complete infrastructure.
- Routine execution must preserve the canonical closure path and avoid heavy
  validation targets in normal loops.

C:
- Planning/control:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`,
  `plan.md`,
  `status.md`,
  `status.json`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
- Primary implementation targets:
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `DecimationToClifford`,
  `PhysicsClosureFull`,
  `CanonicalStageC`,
  `AxiomSet`,
  `Everything`
- Heavy validation boundary:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`

S:
- Infra and merge-prep work are substantially complete.
- The canonical bridge hardening pass is substantially complete.
- The remaining work is concentrated in theorem-closure execution, canonical
  export enforcement, and cleanup of legacy/assumption-backed seams.
- `status.json` previously used stale/noncanonical state values for the
  autonomous orchestrator (`docs=complete`, `tests=partial`).
- Heavy aggregate validation remains unsuitable for routine loops.

L:
- stale orchestration state
  -> normalized orchestrator control plane
  -> execution-ready closure milestone
  -> targeted canonical theorem work
  -> bounded checkpoint validation
  -> promoted canonical closure update

P:
- Proposal A:
  normalize `status.json` to the orchestrator's expected control vocabulary and
  route the next cycle toward `long-running-development`
  Why it helps:
  makes autonomous execution deterministic and aligned with the actual backlog
  Evidence needed:
  repo memory and checklist agree that architecture/audit are complete and
  milestones remain
  Blockers:
  stale docs or contradictory project-memory files
- Proposal B:
  keep one durable framing note that explains why the next work is theorem
  closure rather than setup
  Why it helps:
  prevents future orchestration cycles from rediscovering the same backlog split
  Evidence needed:
  current TODO/status/plan agreement
  Blockers:
  a new higher-priority repo phase displacing closure work

G:
- Promotion criterion for orchestration state:
  `status.json` uses the recognized vocabulary and points to a valid next skill
- Promotion criterion for implementation:
  work follows `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md` in order,
  preserves canonical export discipline, and uses targeted Agda checks
- Guardrail:
  do not treat `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` or full `Everything.agda`
  runs as routine inner-loop validation

F:
- Missing/weak control-plane state for the autonomous runner
- Remaining theorem/backlog distance on the closure checklist
- Unfinished isolation of assumption-backed legacy seams
- Heavy validation cost still blocks routine aggregate checks

Synthesis:
The repo is past setup. The orchestrator should now be driven by a normalized
control plane that routes directly into the remaining canonical closure work.

Adequacy:
adequate

Next action:
Route the next autonomous cycle to `long-running-development` against
`Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`, while treating heavy closure
summary targets as checkpoint-only.

## GSD Routing Result

Project phase:
- existing project
- existing active milestone
- planning-to-execution handoff for the remaining canonical closure spine

Normalized project memory:
- present:
  `spec.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`,
  `devlog.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
- active authoritative checklist:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`

Chosen next skill:
- `autonomous-orchestrator` as control plane
- next routed child skill: `long-running-development`

Reason:
- architecture is already complete
- audit state is already known
- docs are now synchronized enough for execution
- milestones remain and are concrete

Checkpoint:
- Goal is concrete: finish remaining canonical closure/theorem checklist
- Inputs/outputs are defined by the checklist and canonical export surfaces
- Failure mode is understood: drift into heavy aggregate validation or legacy
  assumption routes
- Next skill is obvious: `long-running-development`
