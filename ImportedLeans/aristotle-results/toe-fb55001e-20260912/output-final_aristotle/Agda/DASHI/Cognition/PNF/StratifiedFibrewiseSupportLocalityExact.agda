-- Streaming / fibrewise / progressive / stratified execution law.
--
-- Runtime motivation (SensibLaw close diagnostics, 2026-08-21): close ordinal
-- is not itself a semantic state variable.  Genuine closes through ordinal
-- 4096 varied with local adjacency/anaphor activity but did not exhibit simple
-- monotone growth with accumulated document state.  The correct locality law
-- is therefore not "every close has constant cost".  It is:
--
--   global close/work must factor through the support of the closing fibre at
--   its active semantic stratum.
--
-- Unrelated accumulated state may be arbitrarily larger.  If it does not alter
-- the active local support projection, it cannot alter either the semantic close
-- result or the charged work under a certified support-local implementation.
--
-- This is internal DASHI/ITIR mathematics; no external DOI is asserted.
