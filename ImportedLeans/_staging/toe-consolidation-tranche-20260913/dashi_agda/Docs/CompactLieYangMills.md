# Compact Lie groups in the DASHI Yang–Mills route

This surface separates three obligations that were previously easy to conflate:
1. exact algebra and lattice identities that Agda can check locally;
2. standard finite-dimensional compact-Lie-group theorems imported through an explicit authority socket;
3. conditional and conjectural analytic targets required by the four-dimensional Balaban/Clay route.
## Proof levels
`CompactLieProofLevel.agda` defines five levels:
| Level | Meaning | Locally promotable |
|---|---|---|
| `computed` | definitional or normalized computation | yes |
| `machineChecked` | theorem proved from repository inputs | yes |
| `standardImported` | established external theorem, isolated at an authority boundary | no |
| `conditional` | theorem proved after named hypotheses are supplied | no |
| `conjectural` | exact target type with no witness yet | no |
A conjectural record is executable theorem **shape**, not evidence that the theorem holds.
## Machine-checked layer
The exact surface proves or assembles:
- ordinary consequences of the group axioms, including cancellation, inverse involution, conjugation, and internal-vertex cancellation;
- path-holonomy gauge covariance for an arbitrary group and arbitrary directed lattice;
- gauge invariance of every closed-loop class-function observable;
- structural covariance of transported-log block averaging;
- repeated-commutator majorants from a single bracket constant;
- the Cartan-family rank, dimension, and dual-Coxeter formulas as total computations;
- a concrete `SU(2)` Lie algebra over the existing imaginary-quaternion carrier, including bilinearity and Jacobi;
- a concrete generic adjoint representation, with exact identity, product, linearity, and bracket-automorphism laws proved from quaternion multiplication;
- weighted-column estimate to pointwise exponential kernel decay;
- `C_G L_N ≤ ρ` plus the local critical-map estimate to a contraction estimate at `ρ`;
- assembly of fixed-point/critical-point, minimizer, gauge-orbit, and analytic-dependence interfaces into the background-field package;
- finite reflection positivity from an explicit sum-of-squares factorization and preservation under compatible blocking pullback.
The quaternion rotation polynomials therefore become a concrete implementation of generic `Ad`, rather than a dependency of the generic theory.
## Concrete SU(N) matrix lane
The next surface adds a finite-matrix presentation that is independent of quaternion accidents:
- `SUNMatrixCarrier.agda` defines special-unitary matrices by the equations
  `U†U = I`, `UU† = I`, and `det U = 1`, then assembles the group structure;
- `SUNMatrixLieAlgebra.agda` defines traceless anti-Hermitian matrices and the commutator bracket, then assembles the Lie algebra;
- `SUNMatrixLieGroup.agda` defines matrix conjugation as `Ad`, and assembles the compact-simple Lie-group interface from explicit topology/exponential authority;
- `SUNMatrixGeometry.agda` assembles the invariant trace metric, bi-invariant distance, quantitative local exponential chart, and group-dependent bracket/adjoint constants;
- `SU3MatrixInstance.agda` fixes `N = 3` and computes `dim su(3) = 8`;
- `SUNWilsonClassFunction.agda` turns normalized real trace into a checked class function and instantiates closed-loop gauge invariance;
- `SUNWilsonAction.agda` defines the finite plaquette sum and proves gauge invariance of the full Wilson action by induction over plaquettes;
- `SUNWilsonReflectionPositivity.agda` converts the standard Peter–Weyl/Haar interface factorization into a finite OS-positive Wilson form.
Finite complex-matrix algebra, determinant identities, compactness, connectedness, simplicity, exponential-chart facts, cyclicity of trace, and the Peter–Weyl interface factorization are `standardImported`. The subtype construction and all group/Lie/metric/chart/Wilson/OS record assembly are `machineChecked`.
## Standard imported layer
`CompactLieAnalyticPackage.agda` states the actual theorem interfaces for:
- an invariant positive metric and bi-invariant group distance;
- a quantitative local exponential/logarithm chart;
- BCH with a cubic remainder bound;
- normalized Haar integration;
- Peter–Weyl orthogonality, completeness, Weyl integration, and character bounds.
`CompactLieStandardAuthority.agda` is the sole imported theorem socket for these classical facts. It also provides the explicitly named imported `SU(2)` analytic package. These witnesses are deliberately not marked locally promotable.
## Constructive analytic stack
`ConstructiveYangMillsNextSurface.agda` compiles the proof chain in the order in which the mathematics must close:
1. `BalabanFiniteInverseConsequences.agda` derives injectivity and uniqueness from the finite Hessian/Green inverse certificate;
2. `BalabanFiniteCoerciveGreen.agda` isolates the standard finite-dimensional coercivity-to-inverse theorem and checks its conversion into the repository's Green and inverse certificates;
3. `BalabanUniformNeumannAsymptoticResidual.agda` separates finite Neumann control from geometric-power vanishing;
4. `BalabanGeometricNeumannClosure.agda` composes ordered multiplication, strict contraction, and Archimedean power coverage into uniform unit-ball residual decay;
5. `BalabanFiniteVolumeBackgroundLane.agda` factors the critical-map estimate into patchwise Green constants, nonlinear Lipschitz constants, local factors, and a strict common factor;
6. `BalabanSU2FiniteBackgroundAssembly.agda` derives fixed-point existence, criticality, uniqueness on the gauge slice, minimization, and membership of every critical orbit in the canonical background orbit;
7. `BalabanOneStepRGClosure.agda` exposes fluctuation coordinates, Jacobian/determinant control, BCH control, Ward identities, localization, vacuum-energy and coupling renormalization, and the irrelevant polymer remainder;
8. `BalabanStepVKPClosure.agda` separates polymer activity, entropy, suppression, and the final Kotecký–Preiss comparison;
9. `BalabanAllScaleRGClosure.agda` proves the exact induction from one-step invariant-domain preservation to admissibility at every finite scale;
10. `FiniteReflectionPositivity.agda`, `SUNWilsonReflectionPositivity.agda`, and `ReflectionPositiveBlocking.agda` provide the finite Wilson OS positivity and compatible-blocking lane;
11. `BalabanOSMassGapClosure.agda` separates continuum OS axioms, standard OS reconstruction, uniform clustering, and the physical spectral-gap transfer;
12. `BalabanDashenGrossCalibration.agda` makes the generator, lattice-spacing, determinant, and coupling-scheme normalization factors explicit.
## Quantitative frontier closure
The latest layer replaces the remaining opaque arrows with exact quantified theorem interfaces:
- `BalabanUniformGreenNonlinearProduct.agda` represents
  `sup_{Λ,k,U₀,P} C_G L_N ≤ ρ_G < 1` by its exact order-theoretic content: one common strict factor bounds every indexed product. It derives the uniform residual-contraction target;
- `BalabanOneStepPolymerEstimate.agda` splits the one-step remainder into background, Jacobian, determinant, BCH, and localization contributions and proves their additive budget estimate;
- `BalabanConcreteOneStepRG.agda` feeds that estimate into the existing one-step RG certificate rather than assuming a bounded output polymer wholesale;
- `BalabanConcreteStepVSuppression.agda` uses the explicit entropy × large-field × transfer-cut majorant and derives the Kotecký–Preiss certificate;
- `BalabanQuantitativeAllScaleInvariant.agda` splits admissibility into coupling, field-radius, polymer, analyticity, gauge-fixing, and locality components, then proves the all-scale induction from componentwise preservation;
- `BalabanContinuumOSLimit.agda` separates cutoff OS0–OS5, convergence, and closure of each axiom under the chosen limit topology, then assembles the continuum Schwinger system;
- `BalabanMassGapSurvival.agda` separates finite-cutoff spectral gaps, a common positive lower bound, and spectral convergence, then derives the surviving continuum gap;
- `BalabanUniformToMassGapChain.agda` assembles all resulting certificates in dependency order without constructing any unresolved analytic input.
The bridge theorems are `machineChecked`. The existence of the four-dimensional uniform Green/nonlinear constants, concrete Step V suppression, all-scale invariant data, continuum convergence, and a cutoff-uniform positive gap remains `conjectural`. The standard closure theorems for OS limits and spectral convergence remain `standardImported` authority boundaries.
## Proof-level audit
`scripts/audit_constructive_yang_mills_levels.py` runs before the focused Agda check. It verifies that the locally checked assembly modules contain no `postulate`, authority boundaries retain `standardImported`, frontier fields retain `conditional` or `conjectural`, and the Clay promotion flag remains explicitly false.
## Remaining analytic frontier
The new modules no longer leave the theorem chain structurally unspecified. They leave the following mathematical witnesses unresolved:
- one strict `ρ_G < 1` and one product estimate uniform in volume, scale, admissible background, and patch regime;
- the five concrete one-step polymer component estimates;
- four-dimensional entropy-versus-suppression and transfer-cut estimates strong enough for KP summability;
- componentwise preservation of the quantitative RG invariant domain with summable errors;
- tightness/convergence of the cutoff Schwinger family and closure hypotheses for OS0–OS5;
- a positive cutoff-uniform inverse correlation length or transfer-matrix gap and the hypotheses of the continuum spectral-transfer theorem.
The final mass-gap target has no unconditional constructor and cannot self-promote.
## Quantifier discipline
The intended theorem is group-parametric:
```text
for every compact simple G
there exist group constants ε_G, μ_G, ρ_G, C_G
such that the estimates are uniform in lattice scale, volume,
background, and patch regime.
```
It does **not** demand a single numerical constant uniform over all compact simple groups.

# Generic compact Lie-group layer for Yang–Mills
The existing SU(2) development remains the concrete proof-development carrier.  This tranche adds the abstraction boundary required before any Yang–Mills theorem can be stated for every compact simple gauge group.
## Layering
`CompactLieGroupCore.agda` defines:
- groups and Lie algebras;
- exponential/logarithm and adjoint action;
- adjoint functoriality and bracket preservation;
- explicit compactness, connectedness, and Lie-algebra simplicity witnesses;
- group and Lie-algebra homomorphisms.
`CompactLieGroupGeometry.agda` owns the quantitative local geometry:
- an invariant inner product, norm, and bi-invariant distance;
- a uniform exponential chart and inverse chart;
- dexp, inverse-dexp, bracket, and adjoint-Lipschitz bounds;
- the distinction between group-dependent constants and scale/volume/background-uniform estimates.
`CompactLieRepresentationData.agda` owns finite-dimensional representation data:
- rank, dimension, roots, bases, and structure constants;
- bounded root and structure-constant data;
- normalized left/right invariant Haar measure and Weyl integration;
- character bounds, spectral gaps away from the center, and tensor-product control.
`CompactLieYangMillsBridge.agda` collects the analytic obligations needed by the Balaban lane:
- generic gauge actions and gauge fixing;
- Faddeev–Popov coercivity;
- equivariant block averaging;
- small-field chart compatibility;
- large-field suppression and polymer diameter entropy;
- reflection positivity and cluster decomposition;
- one-step and iterated RG, infinite-volume limit, exponential clustering, and a positive mass gap.
## SU(2) relationship
The quaternion and rotation-polynomial modules are not discarded.  They should instantiate the generic records for `G = SU(2)` and prove that their concrete adjoint action agrees with generic `Ad`.  Quaternion polynomial identities then prove the SU(2) instance only; they cannot inhabit the generic theorem without a separate uniform compact-Lie-group argument.
## Claim boundary
This tranche supplies typed interfaces and promotion boundaries.  It does not prove the generic analytic estimates, construct Haar measure, classify root systems, establish a uniform RG iteration, or prove the four-dimensional Yang–Mills mass gap.  Those remain explicit fields rather than postulates hidden inside the SU(2) implementation.
- assembly of fixed-point/critical-point, minimizer, gauge-orbit, and analytic-dependence interfaces into the background-field package.
## Conditional and conjectural frontier
`CompactLieYangMillsFrontier.agda` records the current status without erasing theorem shape.
Conditional inputs:
- concrete all-patch weighted Green estimates;
- nonlinear residual Lipschitz constants;
- constrained Hessian coercivity;
- nonlinear gauge-fixing contraction;
- the fully instantiated background-field closure.
Conjectural targets:
- one strict residual factor `ρ_G < 1` uniform in scale, volume, admissible background, and patch regime;
- four-dimensional large-field / Step V polymer suppression;
- an all-scale four-dimensional RG invariant domain with summable errors;
- continuum Schwinger functions satisfying OS0–OS5;
- an OS-reconstructed Hamiltonian with a positive physical spectral gap.
The final mass-gap target has no constructor here and cannot self-promote.
- `SU3MatrixInstance.agda` fixes `N = 3` and computes `dim su(3) = 8`.
Finite complex-matrix algebra, determinant identities, compactness, connectedness, simplicity, and exponential-chart facts are `standardImported`. The subtype construction and all group/Lie/metric/chart record assembly are `machineChecked`.
