/-- Fail-closed receipts under the approved completion assumption.

For P≠NP, RH and BSD, failure to have located the final donor is a proof-graph
resolution state, not evidence that new mathematics is required.  Navier--Stokes
has already reached literal external `FeffermanC` and `FeffermanD` theorem terms;
it remains non-GREEN solely until exact-head kernel/axiom verification is recorded.
Hodge and Yang--Mills remain upstream specification defects. -/
